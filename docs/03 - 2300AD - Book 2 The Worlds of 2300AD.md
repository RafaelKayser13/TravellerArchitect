## This Brings Us To Now

For most of humanity, history started (or restarted) in 2079. This marks the end of what has come to be called the Twilight Era and beginning of the French Renaissance. Due to the destruction of almost all the world's information infrastructure and subsequent loss of electronic records, the details for the period from 1995 until 2070 are largely lost. Only fragments survive, with stories, anecdotes and the scars of nuclear war. Who started the war, and why, has been forgotten. The only things known are the targets, cities and towns destroyed almost at random. While San Diego and Moscow appear obvious in their destruction, others are far less so, including sleepy cities like Kamloops in Canada, Changhua in Taiwan and Goose Creek in the United States. Military and economic targets were one thing but these smaller centres defied explanation, especially when seemingly obvious targets, like Honolulu or St. Petersburg, were untouched.

In 2079, France opened its borders, closed since the beginning of the Twilight period and began courting trade and diplomatic relations with European and African nations, along with a select few from the rest of the world. At this point, a physically smaller United States was just starting to recover from a three-way civil war, the remnants of Russia were waging a low-key war with a shattered Germany, while India and China had virtually disintegrated. Most nations still had only tenuous control of their peripheral regions, with local governments holding power away from the capital regions. French support and trade allowed many nations to consolidate and begin recovery, which benefited French industry and shipping.

The cargo airship fleet that had allowed France to trade with its isolated African allies during Twilight now permitted a jump start for trade. Most seaport facilities were damaged or destroyed, or had fallen into disrepair. French airships allowed these ports to be bypassed and gave France a decided advantage until ports could be re-opened and oceanic shipping resumed decades later.

### Diversion

On July 7, 2089, the first manned spacecraft since the beginning of Twilight blasted off from the French launch facility in French Guiana, the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG). While the rocket was a more-or-less conventional multi-stage system, the payload was far from ordinary. On top of the rocket was the Martel, a nuclear-powered plasma-drive spacecraft with a crew of two. The Martel carried a smaller spacecraft, the Ikarus, an unmanned vehicle equipped with a chemical rocket and reconditioned TN-81 thermonuclear warhead. The Martel would take four months to reach its target, the near-Earth asteroid 2075 NM2197 detected by France when the Sagan array was reactivated. Further study revealed that it had a greater than 90% probability of striking Earth. At a size comparable to the rock that ended the reign of the dinosaurs, it was a potential extinction level event for humanity.

**Why People?**  
Historians have long pondered why the diversion mission included a crew. It would have been much simpler to use an automated system to deliver the warhead that nudged 2075 NM2197 onto a new course. The answer has been that the decision was justified, as the intervention of the crew was necessary to complete the mission. This response is as much a diversion as the original mission, however.

The mission was to have the Ikarus intercept the asteroid and detonate its weapon, nudging the asteroid onto a different course. Unfortunately, the Ikarus malfunctioned, with the terminal guidance system and chemical rocket rendered inoperable. Faced with this calamity, the crew, Capitaine Marie Taha and Lieutenant Nikolas de Sale, chose to approach the asteroid with the Martel and detonate the warhead manually. 2075 NM2197 was diverted and the two astronauts became heroes not just of France but of the world. This event is commemorated across human space as Ikarus Day, observed on August 12th every year.

The success of the mission, and valiant sacrifice of the two officers of L'Armée de l'Air, gave France the final leverage it needed to re-open relations with many nations and start trade flowing again. The French Renaissance had begun. Within 60 years, France and its allies would develop the stutterwarp drive and reach out to the stars, cementing France in its dominant role atop the world order.

### To The Stars

After France blazed into space to secure the future from extinction, it made space development a priority. Within 30 years, France and its allies had reached the Moon, gone to Mars and were starting to mine asteroids. Other nations followed as they could. Eventually, permanent settlements were established, along with manned Earth-orbital stations and large habitats. The expanded Sagan array gave humanity glimpses of extrasolar planets and allowed spectrographic analysis of distant atmospheres. By 2130, at least 10 potentially-habitable worlds had been discovered within 15 light years of Earth.

In 2112 the theoretical basis for a practical star drive was established and by 2130 several research establishments were well on their way to demonstrating a prototype. The race for a star drive occupied the technological abilities of the major world powers for the first half of the 22nd Century. Advances in computers, material science and even biology were all driven by this common goal.

The first working starship was produced by the European Space Agency in 2132; its members developed the technology and jointly operated the ship and its successors. The first expedition to Alpha Centauri in 2144 confirmed the presence of a veritable garden world, validating the work of the Sagan array. This world, named Tirane, was promptly claimed by the ESA nations. Within short order, Argentina, China and America built and launched their own starships on expeditions to Alpha Centauri, Barnard's Star and Wolf 359.

### The War for the Stars

The nations of the ESA (France, Britain, Bavaria and Azania) claimed Tirane for themselves and made it known in no uncertain terms that trespassers would not be tolerated. While the United States and Ukraine made diplomatic protests, Argentina built the first interstellar warships. In the face of armed Argentine vessels, the ESA attempted to counter by arming the exploratory cruisers used to stake their claim. While subsequent battles were indecisive, they did force the ESA nations to withdraw their cruisers. At the same time, the Argentinean forces were unable to press their advantage.

Other nations intervened, including the United States and Australia, and brokered a cease-fire. With this in place and the precious exploratory cruisers safe, Australia stepped up to secure a lasting agreement. It was clear from the work of the Sagan array that there were many potentially habitable worlds within reach of humanity and the question of sharing and joint colonisation was likely to occur with increasing frequency. The Melbourne Accords took years to draft and ratify, all the while delaying colonisation of Tirane and a handful of worlds discovered by other powers. In the end, however, the Accords did more than allow for the sharing of worlds. They provided a framework for future sharing of space, from planetary orbits to asteroid belts and became the closest thing to international law humanity has. The dispute arbitration panels and regular annual meetings of the signatories of the Accords are the most effective international forum available, although by 2300 they are losing their influence as the Frontier looks to expand without direction from the Core.

### Age of Exploration

With the Melbourne Accords in place, the following century saw explored space widen in a rough sphere about 20 lightyears from Earth and settlements were established on 10 extra-solar planets. Worlds close to Sol sprouted many national colonies; diversity enabled these colonies to concentrate on specific industries and trade with the others for their needs. But as nations explored further from Earth, they colonised whole worlds and exploited them without competition. Of course, under the terms of the Melbourne Accords, other nations could settle these worlds but most of the outer worlds saw only one or two nations establish colonies.

Each of these new worlds had different environmental challenges to overcome, lumped together in a malady called Planetary Adaptation Syndrome (PAS). Differences in gravity, air pressure, oxygen partial pressure, the partial pressure of other gases, day lengths and a host of other factors made each new world significantly more hostile than Earth or even Tirane. Tirane was such a placid world that settlement proved a poor model for colonisation. The later development of tailored DNA modifications provided permanent relief for those who chose it. Some, however, viewed such engineering as a corruption of their essential humanity. These viewpoints would coalesce into the Hard Path and the Soft Path.

The Hard Path and the Soft Path describe philosophical approaches to colonisation. The Soft Path emphasises adapting to a world and becoming part of a world's ecosystem, while the Hard Path uses technological solutions and adapting worlds to humanity, at least to some degree.

The stutterwarp drives of this era were far less efficient than the drives that would follow and the 20-light year extent of these initial explorations was about the limit, with even those voyages taking many months to complete. It was not until the early 2190s and the development of the oft-called Phase II stutterwarp that longer journeys became practical. Drive efficiencies were increased 100-fold, opening practically limitless opportunities for exploration.

By 2199, the Second Age of Exploration was drawing to a close. Earth had explored worlds within easy reach of Phase I drives and established colonies dedicated to exploiting their resources. With development of the next generation of stutterwarp drives, not only were the frontiers about to be pushed back, star travel was now fast enough and inexpensive enough that true commerce could flourish.

### Consolidation and Contact

Interstellar exploration was always a costly endeavour. Even with new, faster drives, travelling between the stars took money and resources. As the Second Age of Exploration wound down, the Age of Consolidation spun up. Nations were now concerned with seeing a return on their investments, beyond the prestige of owning interstellar colonies. The largest colonial powers cemented their holdings and extracted maximum value from them. With the focus on economics and the increasing distances to the edge of the Frontier, exploration lost emphasis among the great powers.

The star-faring nations built fleets to service their colonies, as even a truly self-sufficient colony is useless if it cannot provide feedback, products, information or resources to its parent. Ships carrying colonists to the stars are most efficient when they carry products and raw materials on their return voyage.

Problems with Planetary Adaptation Syndrome on some colony worlds led to the development and adoption of DNA modifications, engineered human changes using retroviruses to rebuild human genetics. DNA modifications never became popular in the Core and indeed the media tended to portray recipients of DNA modification as something less than human. Other worlds and colonies adopted more traditional approaches with adaptive technologies, such as air filters and protective clothing.

On Earth, recovery from Twilight led to increased nationalism and from there to conflict. Warfare continued to stalk the birthplace of humanity and even Tirane saw spill-over from these nationalist conflicts. While war simmered and bubbled in the Core, out on the Frontier momentous things were happening.

After the initial discovery of alien ruins on the Manchurian and French Arms, it was accepted as inevitable that humanity would soon meet other intelligence. In 2251 that became reality, with the first contact between a starship of the alien Pentapods and a human survey team. Over the next 50 years, another four species were encountered, including two space-faring societies. Evidence suggested at least three alien species had inhabited the region in the past with a real, if remote, possibility of their return.

With these first contacts came increased cultural diversity into the increasing convergent human culture. Academic investigation of these alien cultures provided new insights into Earth's own cultures, both past and present.

#### Alien Contact Time Line

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2230s | Eber Ruins Discovered |
| 2240s | Ruins discovered on Hrunting, inner moon of Beowulf |
| 2251 | First contact with living intelligent species, the Pentapods |
| 2257 | First contact with the Ebers, descendants of the species that built the ruins in the Chinese Arm |
| 2259 | First contact with the Sung |
| 2261 | Realisation that the Xiang were actually intelligent and enslaved by the Sung; Slaver War |
| 2295 | First contact with the Kaefers |
| 2298 | Kaefers attack Station Arcture (Arcturus Observatory) and the distant colony world of Aurore |
| 2299 | First contact with the Arbors at DM+17 2611 |

Humanity went to war with one of these species, the space-faring, but not interstellar-capable, Sung and may yet be plunged into a full-scale war with the belligerent Kaefers. The war against the Sung was an absolute victory for humanity, lasting only a few weeks with minimal human casualties, although with the utter destruction of the space military forces available to the ruling nation of the Sung and many of their allies.

It remains to be seen whether the current conflict with the Kaefers is merely a misunderstanding or the opening phase of something far larger and more destructive.

Continued contact with the Pentapods led to some disturbing insights. These masters of biotechnology have so thoroughly embraced genetic engineering as a cornerstone of their technology and culture that they now draw little differentiation between themselves and their machines, and there is considerable evidence that the most sophisticated Pentapod devices, like their starships, are engineered from something very like the Pentapods that most people are familiar with.

Considerable effort had been spent by agencies and governments, most notably the Life Foundation, to advance technologies and techniques that would allow humans to adapt to colony worlds at the biological level. This so-called Soft Path was thought to be more effective for long-term colonisation of often-hostile worlds. The alternative, the Hard Path, is more reliant on access to the homeworld and advanced technologies.

With the insight gained from examining Pentapod society, many groups across the Core began to experience misgivings about the Soft Path. In the Pentapods, they saw how this path could go wrong, how humans could lose their humanity as they became tools of the colonisation process.

Ongoing concerns around human genetic engineering and other components of the Soft Path led to many large-scale demonstrations in the Core, where a moratorium on further DNA modification research was announced in 2277. Work is ongoing with animals and crops but further research in human DNA modification is prohibited by all nations signatory to the Algiers Protocol on Human Genetic Modification. All terrestrial nations except Vanuatu and Iran ratified the Protocols as a treaty by 2280. The Iranian opposition is unusual as Iran has always stood against human DNA modification. However, in voicing their opposition to the Protocol, Iran stated it was uncomfortable with a far-reaching multilateral treaty. It should be noted that as of 2298, neither Elysia nor Tanstaafl, independent Frontier nations in their own right, have ratified the Protocol.

#### The Hard Path

Critics of the Soft Path often fail to understand that the Hard Path, taken it its extreme, would have the same results; the loss of individual humanity, this time in service to machines. Ironically, the most obvious example of this is the implant-linked Demarchist society of the Cousteau colony which was developed by the Life Foundation, champions of the Soft Path.

### Drift

Among the colonial powers, the maturation of colonies led to economic and cultural crisis. The economies of France and many of the Tier 2 nations had been structured along mercantile lines, where they purchased raw materials from colonies and in return the colonies purchased finished goods from the home nations. By the middle of the 23rd century, however, many colonies on the American and French Arms were effectively independent or conducted trade with other colonies. This disrupted the balance of trade, as the mother nations still purchased raw materials from the colonies but the colonies had less need of finished goods. This economic slump, on the heels of the consolidation efforts of the first half of the century, accounts for the lack of colonial efforts by many of the established Tier 2 nations during this period. Most of the colonisation programs of the second half of the 23rd century were by emerging Tier 3 powers like Brazil, Texas and Canada. At the same time, many Core nations and their colonies had long-defined themselves by their interrelationships and the drifting away of the most mature colonies challenged these long-held views.

The relative ease of travel on and off Earth enabled many to maintain mobile life-styles without permanent residence. Some, such as explorers, starship crew and orbital workers, found themselves taxed based on geography but not receiving any benefit from those taxes. Others found deference and status came with national citizenship rather than merit. Some interest groups created their own non-territorial 'nations' to better protect their interests. Others rejected nationality completely.

At the same time, more came to reject nationalism, finding more in common with ethnic, religious, ethical or professional values. The Link network enabled these groups to form virtual communities and, increasingly, physical communities in nations that shared their values. People began shopping for citizenship like any other commodity. Good national citizenship remained a convenience, and the wrong one could be a hindrance, but many had come to feel there were higher values than mere geographic allegiance. Many of these new communities ended up forming the core of colonisation efforts, taking themselves to the stars.

For many on the Frontier, the Central Asian War (2283-2287) on Earth began the retreat from Core-based nationalism. Multiple nations involved themselves in the conflict and the foremost among them, France and Manchuria, entangled their Frontier possessions in the fight. The war had nothing to do with the Frontier, already a hostile enough environment without intentional violence, and as resentment grew across the French and Manchurian Arms, even the cessation of hostilities on Earth did little to dampen growing anger on the Frontier. The subsequent War of German Reunification in 2293 only fanned the fires, as now France and a newly-united Germany were at odds over a terrestrial matter, one that again had nothing to do with the worlds and peoples of the Frontier.

With German victory in the War of German Reunification, and the subsequent secessions of Flanders from France, the army was forced to allow the first free elections since the end of the Central Asian War. There are widespread rumours and innuendo that these elections were manipulated to bring Nicholas Ruffin, a prominent industrialist and free market advocate, to power. Under his policies, the French economy rebounded dramatically. France began to look out to space, past the old colonies, to new frontiers in the Wolf Cluster and the stars beyond Arcturus. This emergent France may stumble into conflict with the people of the Frontier, many of whom are eager to push further out and further away from the controlling powers of the Core.

Careful media handling in the years leading up to the 2298 election produced a French population receptive to the idea of establishing a new empire. Inclusion of the question in a plebiscite attached to the 2298 elections led to the formation of the Third Empire, with Ruffin as Emperor, by late 2298. The Chamber of Deputies who appointed Ruffin hopes to use him as a figurehead, a central rallying point for the ideals of French nationalism. Ruffin, however, may well have other ideas.

For the people on the Frontier, the Core is a very alien place. While it may be the world most suited for their bodies, it is not a good fit for their psyches. The Core is a place where everything is watched, everything is tracked. While the people are told it is to keep them safe, many feel the goal is control. For those who feel that way, the Core feels dangerous. On top of surveillance, there are the constant targeted ads, social pressures to conform and rampant unemployment. While most nations provide for their citizens, it is only barely enough to get by.

### Earth

While recovered from Twilight and the centuries of intermittent war that followed, Earth is still a tense place of competing nations and corporations. Nowhere else in human space is the gap between the high and the low as pronounced as on Earth. Even nations have a hierarchy, with terms dictated by the Great Powers like France, Manchuria and Azania.

Earth is a little cooler than past centuries, although ocean levels are still higher than they were at the start of the 21st Century. Most manufacturing and power generation has moved off-planet, along with resource extraction and even some food production. Despite the constant tension, Earth is a pleasant world and life for citizens of most nations, at least those from Tier 1–4 nations, are largely good, albeit controlled.

#### A World of Tiers

Tier is a general description of a nation's status and power; the higher the value, the lower its status. Many nations chafe at the status assigned to them, in particular how Tier 3 and above is limited to states with off-world colonies. The commonly-voiced belief is that the mere presence of extra-solar colonies has little real relevance to the strength of a nation's economy or the influence it can exert.

##### Tier 1

At the top sits the French Empire. This includes not only European France but also French holdings across the globe.

- Life Expectancy: 115 years
- Literacy: 100%
- College Education: 89%

##### Tier 2

At Tier 2 are the largest colonial powers, those with the most colonies and the biggest fleets to defend them. Tier 2 nations have strong economies, fed by off-world resources and orbital factories. Along with France, these nations comprise the Great Powers, the nations who make the global rules.

- Life Expectancy: 112 years
- Literacy: 100%
- College Education: 88%

##### Tier 3

Tier 3 nations are the remainder of the colonial powers. They lack the ability to project much in the way of force over interstellar distances and the bulk of their fleets are smaller craft. Their colonial holdings are often as much about national pride as economic benefits. In terms of quality of life, however, they are the equal or near equal of Tier 1 and 2 nations.

- Life Expectancy: 113 years
- Literacy: 100%
- College Education: 82%

##### Tier 4

Tier 4 nations have little or no off-world interests and are often considered backward by spacefaring nations. Tier 4 nations are the most independent of the Earth nations and often have truly unique cultures, separate from other nations. Many seem resigned to their low status and, for some, this contentment is starting to give way to simmering resentment at being dealt out of humanity's most ambitious development, that of extra-solar colonisation.

- Life Expectancy: 100–110 years
- Literacy: 91%
- College Education: 85%

##### Tier 5

Nations on the 5th Tier are often categorised as lesser-developed, lacking the well-developed transportation and telecommunications infrastructure of other nations. In many ways, Tier 5 nations did not really recover from Twilight and exist at barely more than subsistence level. However, it should be noted that while telecommunications infrastructure is primitive, almost everyone has a Link phone. Starvation is rarely a problem, even if they lack many luxuries. There are only a handful of nations at this level of development, spread across eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Oceania.

- Life Expectancy: 90–100 years
- Literacy: 84%
- College Education: 70%

##### Tier 6

Most Tier 6 nations can be categorised as failed states, where the central government is weak or non-existent. None can be described as having functional economies; corruption is endemic and travel dangerous. Many are suffering internal unrest and even civil war. Unlike most nations at other Tiers, these nations have few things in common. Fortunately, few are at this level.

- Life Expectancy: 60–90 years
- Literacy: 50–70%
- College Education: 20–70%

## The Core: A Most Alien Place

### Nations of the World

*(Map of Earth showing nations by Tier classification)*

### Beyond Earth

Much of the solar system is settled, or at least exploited, including Luna, Mars and the asteroid belt. Earth orbital space is crowded, dominated by the Beanstalk and its geosynchronous terminal, Gateway Station. Only the massive habitats at Earth's L4 and L5 points and the Bessieres industrial outpost, are larger.

#### Tirane

Tirane is like Earth's little sibling; trying to catch up but not there yet. In all things culturally, Tirane is a shadow of Earth; while there is surveillance, it is not at the levels seen on Earth. Targeted advertising is not as obtrusive, work is more plentiful and there are far fewer people. Even so, Tirane is the second most populous world in human space after Earth.

Environmentally, Tirane is actually more benign than Earth. The initial discovery and exploration of this world lent false expectations to other explorers and colonists, especially the ill-fated Jumpers.

Tirane was an ideal first step, settled by a number of nations and boasts two of the first extra-solar nations. Wellon, formerly a colony of Britain, declared independence in 2277, while Freihafen, formerly the Bavarian colony of Garten, declared independence only recently, in 2294. The colony's leadership decided they wanted nothing to do with a reunited German super-state. The friction this would cause with the largest colony on Tirane, the French territory of Nouvelle Provence, was more trouble than it was worth.

#### Beyond Tirane

There are a scattering of resource settlements and outposts in the Alpha Centauri A+B system, along with a couple in the companion Proxima system. There are a number of asteroid belts, a result of the tidal and gravitational interplays between the three stars and 19 attendant planets. None of them are as rich as Sol's own asteroid belt.

### Life on the Frontier

Life on the Frontier is a mix of the primitive with the high-tech. A house might be made from rammed-earth blocks but support a satellite uplink to a Link grid, with a solar array in the backyard supplying power to an integrated kitchen module dropped off by airship. The bathroom, however, may be a little shed out back with a composting toilet and little else.

The nearest town might have 50 houses and a general store or it may be a metropolis of 10,000, with real restaurants and services. Horses mix on the streets with fuel-cell-powered tractors and hovercraft, while the skies above see flights of airships and spaceplanes.

The urban areas on any long-settled world will be similar to urban areas in the Core, although there are key differences. The lack of pervasive surveillance is one of the most important ones, along with much more muted advertising. The targeted, directed advertising so common in the Core is almost unknown on the Frontier, save in the domes of Nibelungen and the orbital Beanstalk terminal above Beta Canum. Cities tend to be lower and more spread out as well, more open, with plentiful green space. Most Frontier cities are either very well planned, or else studies in complete anarchy; there is little middle ground. In general, in both urban and rural areas, the pace of life is slower than the Core but that is not to say people are not busy. With 10 jobs for every person, there is always something to be done. Life lacks the desperation so common in the Core, with 10 people for every job.

Most colony worlds will have some sort of spaceport, ranging from a flat expanse of open ground to a facility that looks like a 21st Century international airport. Older colonies have interface transport available, typically a spaceplane or lander. Younger colonies are often dependent on incoming traffic to provide their own interface transport, even if it just a drop pod for incoming cargo.

## Worlds of the Frontier

### The Hard Path and The Soft Path

With the advent of the Jerome-effect stutterwarp drive, humanity began to move out into the stars, settling worlds along the way. Most worlds were hostile to some degree, some extremely so. In the face of these otherworldly dangers, human colonists developed a variety of coping strategies. In the early years, it was a matter of using available technology, which became known as the Hard Path, in part for the use of 'hard' technology, machinery and engineering. The Soft Path evolved later, spurred by the Life Foundation and other pro-colonisation agencies. The Soft Path eschewed machinery and technology, and instead concentrated on biotechnologies, adapting colonists to new worlds rather than the other way around.

#### The Hard Path

The Hard Path is epitomised by visible high technology. These adaptive technologies allow humans to survive, even thrive, on hostile worlds. There is a cost, however. This technology requires constant maintenance and eventually wears out. Economically, this can be a hardship and when a technology fails, it can be very difficult for colonists to cope. Hard Path colony worlds require tremendous support from colonising nations on Earth and often a priority for the colony planners is the establishment of local manufacturing to offset some of the off-world technology required.

On the personal level, these adaptive technologies include filter masks, protective clothing and goggles. Buildings can have filter systems, overpressure to keep contagions and allergens out, and airlocks. In most Hard Path colonies, primary food sources are terrestrial in nature and so vitamin supplements are not required, or only needed for a limited number of vitamins.

Beyond these basic technologies, the Hard Path can include powered exoskeletons for high gravity worlds, assistive cybernetic implants, medical drugs or surgical modifications and, it is rumoured, full body cybernetic replacements. On the civil engineering side, domed cities and sealed arcologies are found in the richest Hard Path colonies. The ultimate expression of the Hard Path lies in two directions. The first are the orbital space habitats of the O'Neill Island Three type, massive structures capable of housing thousands, even millions, in a controlled, engineered environment. The other is terraforming, the remaking of a world in the image of Earth. The Island Three habitats have been available for the last 50 years but full terraforming is still not possible. The closest are partial terraforming projects underway at worlds like Nous Voila and Kie Yuma, where efforts are underway to modify temperatures and local atmospheres to come closer to human norms.

#### The Soft Path

The Soft Path, on the other hand, appears simpler. Rather than applying adaptive technologies to allow people to exist on hostile worlds, sheltering them from it, or changing the world wholesale, the Soft Path instead focuses on adapting humans. While on the face of it these colonists can survive more easily on their worlds, even in low-tech lifestyles, there is a great deal of high-technology involved in the first stages of the Soft Path.

The Soft Path runs a gamut of adaptive techniques, from the simple 'deal with it' found in many poorer colonies, to genetic manipulation. The earliest, and easiest, of these changes are to human micro-flora, adding the ability to digest certain foods or create vitamin complexes missing in the local environment. Further modifications come in the form of symbiotes, additional micro-organisms that live in the blood, lungs and nose, to filter atmosphere taints, improve clotting functions, or a myriad of other requirements that change from world-to-world. Further adaptations focus on plants and animals to acclimatise them to new worlds but the Soft Path tends to favour using locally-available resources whenever possible.

The latest, and most effective, Soft Path techniques are further modifying humans for life on hostile colony worlds. This technology, human DNA Modification, or DNAM (often pronounced Dee-Nam), uses tailored retroviruses originally developed in the fight against cancer to modify somatic (body) cells, forcing physical changes as the body slowly rewrites itself in response to new instructions. Typical modifications can take months, with some of the more severe types taking up to a year. At the end of the process, however, the colonist is well-adapted to life on their new world, enough that, should human interstellar travel suddenly cease, they would still survive. Uplift technologies for some animals to act as protective companions also fit into this category, so long as modifications breed true.

DNA Modifications can be passed to future generations but unless both genetic parents have the same category of modification, the transmission of traits may be incomplete and, in some cases, particularly between different DNAM recipients, the offspring can be non-viable.

The Hard Path is more acceptable to the general public in the Core, who are still uncomfortable with human genetic manipulation. It is also much more useful for transients, specialists, troubleshooters and scouts, who are coming to a world for a specific task and a limited amount of time. However, the Soft Path is more effective for colonists, who will require less support and can survive off the land more effectively. There are situations where the Soft Path will not work, worlds where bio-chemistry is so completely incompatible that DNAM changes are just not possible. Worlds like Beta Canum, Kimanjano and Aurore, on the French Arm, Avalon on the American Arm and Austin's World and Dukou on the Manchurian Arm.

Proponents of the Hard Path, at least on the extreme end of the spectrum, will refer to Hard Path Travellers as true humans and those on the Soft Path as changelings and there is prejudice against changelings on the Core Worlds. Some DNA modifications undertaken have resulted in colonists who are technically no longer human, as they cannot interbreed with baseline humans without significant medical intervention. Even milder modifications can result in genetic incompatibility with modifications designed for other worlds. These modifications are usually compatible with baseline humans, although medical monitoring is highly recommended.

On the other side, extremists on the Soft Path refer to those who push the Hard Path and indeed all baseline humans, as 'gnorms' (Genetic NORMals) or, more pejoratively, breeders. This last comes from the notion that any DNA-modified human can interbreed with a baseline human. While this is correct for the more limited modifications, it does not hold true for the major modifications, like the King Ultra or Triton.

Planetary Adaptation Syndrome ensures most permanent colonists will either have DNA modifications to help them adjust or use assistive technologies like exoskeletons and rebreather masks.

DNA modifications have proven incredibly useful in the colonisation of other worlds. However, since the Moratorium of the 2270s, public attitude in the Core has become increasingly intolerant of human genetic engineering, so much so that most Core nations have laws to prevent colonists from returning to Earth for more than 14 days without undergoing Retrograde Therapy to return them to baseline human. On Tirane, the grace period is 28 days, save in Tundukubwa, the only Core nation/colony that does not seem to care whether people within its borders have undergone DNA modification. Once beyond those borders, however, the 28-day rule applies.

### Interstellar Settlements

There are several classes of settlements among the worlds of the Frontier. These settlements are on worlds, asteroids and the spaces between worlds, and there are rumours of deep space stations, outposts hidden in interstellar space.

Worlds and colonies are described in the following manner and include some changes to the Universal Planetary Profile (UPP) presented in the Traveller Core Rulebook. Unlike the Traveller Core Rulebook, Trade Codes are not part of the UPP and individual colonies instead have their own Trade Codes, listed in the Universal Colony Profile (UCP) for each.

**PRIMARY NAME:** Name of the primary star in the system. There can also be companion stars.  
**STELLAR COORDINATES:** Location of the star on the Galactic Map (see page 12), with the Sol system at 0,0,0.  
**DISTANCE FROM EARTH:** This is the straight-line distance from Earth, not travel distance, which is usually much longer due to the limitations of stutterwarp drive.

#### Planetary Data

The Universal Planetary Profile (UPP) is a short-hand method to provide basic physical and demographic data of a world.

**UPP Format:** ABCDEFG-H I JKL ec

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| A | Starport Type |
| B | World Size |
| C | Atmosphere Type |
| D | Hydrographics (%) |
| E | World Population (all colonies combined) |
| F | World Government Type (7 if Balkanised) |
| G | Law Level (usually lowest on world) |
| H | Tech Level (usually highest on world) |
| I | Bases Present |
| J | Population Multiplier |
| K | Number of Planetoid Belts |
| L | Number of Gas Giants |
| e | PAS Severity |
| c | Compatibility |

**Starport Type**
- Class A: Can build stutterwarp drives; good interface travel available
- Class B: Can build most hull sizes but must import stutterwarp drives
- Class C: Can build small reaction-drive craft; repair facilities for most vessels
- Class D: Little more than large airport with long runways; minor repairs only
- Class E: No more than cleared, level landing strip and beacon; minimal services

#### UCP: THE UNIVERSAL COLONY PROFILE

Just as worlds have a UPP, individual colonies have a UCP, the Universal Colony Profile. This serves as a shorthand method to display relevant colonial information.

**UCP Format:** A-B C DEF G-H J K 12

| F | Law Level |
| G | Tech Level |
| H | Trade Code 1 |
| J | Trade Code 2 |
| K | Population Multiplier |
| 1 | Telecommunications Infrastructure |

**Tier Type**

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|

| 6 | Low income, disrupted economy (failed state) |

**Transportation Infrastructure**

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 | No infrastructure. Completely undeveloped |

| 5 | Good road coverage covering 60% of nation/colony |
| 6 | Good road and rail access covering 60% of nation/colony |
| 7 | Excellent road access covering 80% of nation/colony |
| 8 | Excellent road and rail access covering 80% of nation/colony |
| 9 | As 8, plus underground tube trains connecting largest cities |
| A | As 8, plus underground tube trains connecting major centres |

**Telecommunications Infrastructure**

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 | No networks at all. Personal radios only |
| 1 | Low-speed data and communications access to 10% of nation/colony |
| 2 | Low-speed data and communications access to 30% of nation/colony |

*Note: High-speed networks assume 100% coverage by low-speed networks. Low-speed network = modern high-bandwidth internet (10-100 Megabit range). High-speed = fastest modern fibre optics (10-100 Gigabit range). Augmented reality networks handle heavy loads with speeds in the 10 Terabit per second range.*

**Interface Transport Capability**

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| A | Beanstalk |
| B | Catapult |
| C | Spaceplane |
| D | Ballistic SSTO |
| E | Cargo rocket |
| X | No publicly available interface transportation |

#### Outposts

Some interstellar settlements are outposts: space stations, asteroid bases and bases on hostile worlds. They are typically not self-sustaining, requiring the support of nearby worlds and while some may have permanent inhabitants, most personnel are transient.

**Deep Station**  
The survey vessel Strontium Hound claims to have detected a deep-space station between Beowulf and Kimanjano. Details are sparse, and their log was erased, but the crew claim the station was a large torus, shielded with rock and ice. They say they spotted a thermal spike, consistent with a large radiator surface.

#### Enclaves

Enclaves are large settlements, sometimes full-scale colonies, of one cultural group in a territory surrounded by a different cultural group. Human examples include New Scotland on Beowulf and the many small enclaves on Tirane.

The term enclave is also used to denote settlements of an alien species within the territory of another species. Examples include the Manchurian and Canadian bases on Stark (the Sung homeworld) and the Pentapod base on Beta Canum, a human colony world.

#### Colonies

Between 2167 and 2300, a total of 61 human colonies were established on 33 habitable worlds. While many were marginal at best, the resources and opportunities afforded by colonising them could not be ignored.

In the Colonies table, UPP describes the entire planet, while UCP is a specific colony. Path indicates whether the colony generally follows the Hard Path or Soft Path, keeping in mind that no colonies exclusively subscribe to one or the other.

National colonies enjoy a wide variety of relationships with their home governments. Some remain virtual protectorates, their external affairs managed by the mother country, while others enjoy home rule and send representatives to national legislatures.

#### Independent Colonial Nations and Worlds

In addition to the national colonies, three more were established by independent organisations: Tanstaafl on Aurore, Trilon's terraforming project on Kie-Yuma and the Life Foundation colony of Cousteau on Austin's world. The world of Elysia has gained its independence through armed revolution, while the colony of Tanstaafl, on the distant world of Aurore, gained its independence through the economic collapse of corporations that had founded the colony.

It is easiest to examine the colonies in terms of explored 'Arms', the naturally occurring corridors of colonisation that result from stellar geography. There are three arms and they are almost universally referred to as the American, Manchurian and French Arms, after the major powers that have dominated their exploration and colonisation.

---

## The American Arm

The American Arm is the smallest of the three colonial regions. Although the first American outpost was established in 2160 at Barnard's Star, the opening of the American Arm proper dates from the establishment of the outpost at Broward in 2172. This way station became the crossroads for the American and Manchurian Arms, with one branch leading through Clarkesstar (established 2187) to the rich colony systems of King and then branching at New Melbourne into the Australian Subarm (to the colonies on Botany Bay and Zeta Herculis) and the American Subarm (to the colonies on Mu Herculis and Ellis).

The second principal branch from Broward leads to DM26 12026, the gateway to the Manchurian Arm. The American Arm is a closed branch of stars, with no further 7.7 light year routes remaining out the cluster of stars. Avalon, a water world, is the sole remaining habitable planet available for further expansion.

Colonies on the American Arm tend to receive more support than settlements on the Manchurian Arm but not as much as those of the French Arm. The oldest colonies here are over 100 years old, long enough to have developed a unique culture, although derivative of the mother country.

Colonists on this arm tend to be conservative, placing value in self-reliance and a shared distrust of government, although loyal to their nations. Many of these settlers left Earth because of the encroachment of the surveillance society and a need to regain control. They tend, as a rule, to mind their own business.

American colonies enjoy considerable central support, at least in the construction and maintenance of their infrastructure. Individuals receive decidedly less and have to work harder to survive and flourish. These colonies, more than those of other countries, were not just established for prestige or to garner resources for the mother country but to provide a structured outlet for those who could not deal with the claustrophobic nature of Earth.

*(Chart of the American Arm showing stellar positions and routes)*

**Interstellar Travel Time**  
Depending on mass & drive, between 0.5 and 9.5 light years per day. The maximum distance a vessel can travel is 7.7 light years between stars as a stop in a gravity well is required for drive/crew safety and performance. Stutterwarp discharge requires approx. 40 hours.

### King

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Name | DM+2 3312 |
| Stellar Coordinates | -4.0, -24.2, 0.9 |
| Distance from Earth | 25.54 light years |
| UPP | CD97675-B N 502 E5 |
| Gravity | 3.08G (extreme) |
| Survival | DM-4 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Extremely high gravity, toxic elements in atmosphere.

King is barely-habitable. The gravity is overwhelming, reducing a strong individual to a crushed heap, barely-able to move. Violent seasonal changes, and harsh surface temperatures add to the danger. While there is sufficient oxygen in the atmosphere to support life, it is accompanied by a host of poisonous compounds, in particular sulphur dioxide. The atmospheric pressure is so high that it can cause nitrogen narcosis, with the potential for oxygen poisoning. A sudden rainstorm can damage equipment and even break bones, and erosive forces wreak havoc on mines and structures.

If the planet itself does not kill you, the animal life will. Adapted for the planet's conditions, most predators on King see humans as an easy meal.

King does possess abundant natural resources, including rare earth elements, uranium and other heavy metals. These alone would not have made this punishing world worth exploiting, were it not for the discovery of tantalum, the core of every stardrive.

**New Columbia UCP:** C247645-B N NI 3B  
*Nationality: American*  
The American colony was founded first and initially tried to use tele-operated drones and robots to carry out mining. However, the interference from King's highly-charged ionosphere made the lag unacceptable. Other experiments with exoskeletons and even cyborgs proved unsatisfactory for the number of workers required. The then new technique of DNA modification was a last attempt to make the colony viable.

**Huntsland UCP:** C347544-B N NI 2B  
*Nationality: Australian*  
Founded several years after the American colony, the Australians made use of DNAM technology from the beginning. It was their colony that saw the first, heart-breaking losses in new-born children, prompting the creation of the Orbital Maternity Complex. Pregnant women transfer to the OMC by the end of their first trimester and stay there until the children are a year old. This has created some unusual family dynamics.

### Hermes

### Ellis

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|

| Stellar Coordinates | -6.5, -14.3, 17.6 |
| Distance from Earth | 23.59 light years |
| UPP | C861644-9 N 463 85 |
| Gravity | 0.92G (normal) |
| Survival | DM-1 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Extremely-dry, prone to mote (fine dust) storms.

Ellis is a dry, barren world, with what little water there is locked up in briny lakes and small seas. This water requires extensive treatment before it can be used by humans and their crops and animals. While Ellis has native plants and animal life, they are scattered and in decline. Ellis is also on old world, with low, worn mountains and a notable lack of tectonic activity. The world's magnetic field is weak and the surface is exposed to more radiation than would normally be expected.

Ellis UCP: C275646-A Ag, Ri 5B  
*Nationality: American*  
There are few worlds as important to the daily survival of the American Arm colonies as Ellis. Once a fairly Earth-like world, Ellis has been in a constant spiral toward ecological ruin for millennia. The intrepid colonists who have chosen to settle there, however, are engaged in an effort to halt the ecological decline and restore the planet to some semblance of its former state. As the 24th century dawns, this once barren world is now the pride of the United States, producing a great amount of food that is shipped across the entire American Arm. Most Ellis colonists walk the Soft Path, preferring not to put a protective layer between them and their home.

Only 7% of the surface of Ellis is covered with water, primarily small briny seas around the south pole. This makes most of the planet a dry wasteland. The efforts of colonists, however, are increasing the productivity of the lands around these scattered lake regions. Various efforts are underway to irrigate the wastelands and each year additional farmlands are opened to homesteaders. There is a limit to how far these farmlands can expand, however, due to the extremely limited amount of water available. Trilon is investigating the possibility of transporting ice from elsewhere in the system to Ellis but the research has only just begun.

### Exploratory Worlds

Due to the closed nature of the American Arm, there are few worlds left for further colonial expansion. However, recent activity at the end of one of the closed branches may herald new opportunities.

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Allergens, ocean water is an irritant to most.

This world is the last remaining hospitable world on the American Arm and a likely target for colonisation in the near future. A world of shallow seas and fog-shrouded archipelagos, Avalon's ecology is fragmented, with each island chain having its own unique micro-ecology.

#### New America

In the years prior to the Twilight War, New America was an ultranationalist, ultra-right-wing organisation that included many survivalists, militia members and white supremacists. In the years following the war, they made a determined effort to create their vision of America and embroiled both the military and civilian governments of the time in a decades-long civil war. The movement was eventually defeated and driven underground but has started to resurface on several American colony worlds, in particular Ellis.

## The French Arm

The French Arm vies with the Manchurian Arm as the most extensive grouping of colony worlds. There may be more settled worlds on the Manchurian Arm but the French Arm colonies are generally more-advanced. The Arm contains a total of 12 colony worlds, colonised mainly by France, Britain, Germany and Azania but with settlements by many other nations as well. Most of the worlds have colonies from multiple nations.

The long-settled nature of many of these worlds is a source of considerable acrimony and even conflict, between these worlds and the nations that colonised them. Many of these colonies are growing increasingly disenchanted with their role as adjuncts of national policy and are clamouring for increased home rule, or even independence. The new nation of Elysia is eager to cement unrest among its former colonial brethren and the French government is tightening security all across the Arm.

The recent war of German Reunification on Earth has created tension between formerly peaceable neighbours on many worlds. There is also dissension from many of the former Bavarian colonies, the populations of which are uncertain about submitting to the rule of a new, reunited Germany in which Bavaria plays a subordinate role.

Of the three arms, the French Arm is the most open, with vast numbers of stars awaiting exploration and possible colonisation. Several expeditions have ventured past Hochbaden, into the Wolf Cluster, and there are fortunes to be made. Explorations beyond settled systems has brought contact with the Pentapods and the Kaefers; the possibility of new contacts is real and immediate. However, these contacts are viewed as possibilities for profit or knowledge, or both, and are eagerly sought by the governments and corporations moving out into unexplored space.

Not far past Hochbaden, however, lies the besieged system of Aurore, with the mysterious invaders coming from past Arcturus. While this war gets scant attention in the Core, human military leaders are growing increasingly anxious over the prospect of fighting a war with a civilisation that may well be more advanced than theirs.

### Nibelungen

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|

| UPP | A463844-C N 365 C6 |
| Gravity | 0.63G (low) |
| Survival | DM-2 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Low partial-pressure of oxygen, prone to mote (fine dust) storms.

Nibelungen is a tidally-locked world, with three distinct climatic zones. The most habitable regions of the planet are in the 'Twilight' region between the Hotside and the Coldside. Nibelungen boasts a well-developed local biosphere with significant influxes of Terran species in the settled areas. Vitamin supplements are generally not required.

**Nibelungen UCP:** A264747-B N Ri 9B  
*Nationality: German*  
Nibelungen, the only habitable world in the system, is the site of an extensive colonisation program, one of the most successful ever attempted, especially given the difficulties of colonising a tidally-locked world with a thin atmosphere. The colony on Nibelungen is in direct support of the asteroid mining and ship-building industry, which provides much of the wealth for this colony. The shipyards in particular rival the output of yards in the Core.

### Kimanjano

| UPP | D778676-B N 405 A0 |
| Gravity | 0.94G (normal) |
| Survival | DM-1 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Many allergens and biologically-reactive materials in sea-water.

Although Kimanjano has an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, it possesses no life as it is normally defined. The first expeditions discovered this anomaly and subsequent surveys found the source of the oxygen. The oceans of Kimanjano are an organic soup of chemicals, including many that are commercially valuable. Some of these pre-biotic materials react with the seawater to produce oxygen, while others utilise some of the oxygen in there. Although there is no life, there are things that could almost pass as life-forms, free-floating globs of amino acids and organic chemicals. In additional to the near-life-forms, the oceans of Kimanjano hold a fortune in chemicals, capable of producing everything from construction synthetics to fine perfumes, with a variety of medical compounds thrown in for good measure.

**Fromme UCP:** D126667-C S Na Po 6 0 B  
*Nationality: French*  
The carefully-planned French colony of Fromme was created as a port facility to service the oceanic platforms that harvest the bio-chemical wealth of this unusual world. The catapult makes delivery of cargo and materials into orbit easy and economical. Fromme includes seaport facilities, including ship construction, maintenance yards, warehouses and an industrial processing facility the size of a small city, L'Usine (The Works).

**Okavango UCP:** E373544-B 0 Na Po 9 0 C  
*Nationality: Azanian*  
In contrast to the French colony site, the Azanian site was a study in inspired anarchy. Very much the latecomers, the Azanians established a permanent settlement in 2280. Their colony consists of standardised, commercially purchased modular units. These have been set down with apparently no order, scattered over a 20-square-mile region roughly surrounding a small bay. There is a landing strip just beside the bay. While the Azanians likewise exploit the rich pre-biotic soup of the planet, they also grow a significant portion of the world's food.

**The Circus**  
The Amazing Interstellar Circus consists of three travelling shows, each based in one of the Arms of exploration. The Circus visits a new world each month and stays for about a week, providing shows and entertainment for the entire planet. Costs of the Circus are partly subsidised by the major governments and sponsoring corporations. There are rumours of something dark behind the Circus, although the story varies from Arm-to-Arm. In the Manchurian Arm these stories are linked to ProVolution, in the American Arm to smugglers and slavers and in the French Arm either to Pentapods or Colonial Secessionists.

### Kie-Yuma

| Gravity | 1.21G (high) |
| Survival | DM-2 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Many allergens and biologically-reactive materials in sea-water.

The atmosphere of Kie-Yuma is denser than that of Earth and often appears 'hazy' or 'murky' to the colonists on the surface. With an oxygen content well within human tolerances Kie-Yuma's air is quite breathable (although a bit 'thick' and 'heavy' to breath for those used to an Earth-normal pressure) except for a relatively small fraction of unsavoury gases and biological components present. Most of the world's animal life lives in the seas, while the land is home only to plants and primitive insect-like creatures.

**Kie-Yuma (colony) UCP:** C679528-C Po Na 5B  
*Nationality: Corporate (Trilon)*  
As a corporate colony, Kie-Yuma is unique in human space. First settled in 2260, Trilon has continued to expand the colony, making it the focus of their efforts on the French Arm. With the extensive orbital facilities, it is likely that Trilon will shift production for the colonial markets from Earth to Kie-yuma. All corporate colonists on the surface of the world live in habitats, due to the trace poisons and plant spores that cause strong histamine reactions in most people. Trilon is in the process of terraforming the world to suit them better, although under considerable protest from NARL and the Life Foundation.

In 2288, the first group of ethnic Kurds settled in the south of the main continent, much to Trilon's displeasure. The TransNat does everything it can to make life difficult for the Kurdish settlers and their nomad crawlers but so far the Kurdish settlers seem to have little interest in the corporation and its holdings.

### Beta Canum

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Name | Beta Canum Venaticorum |
| Stellar Coordinates | -22.2, -3.1, 19.8 |
| Distance from Earth | 29.91 light years |
| UPP | A766775-B N 514 8 1 |
| Gravity | 0.94G (normal) |
| Survival | DM-1 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Incompatible biosphere, poisons and allergens common.

While Beta Canum appears to be a pleasant, even Earth-like world, the biosphere is fundamentally-incompatible with terrestrial biology. Everything on the planet either has no nutritional value, or else is potentially-poisonous. While terran amino acids have a left-handed chirality, or twist, amino acids on Beta Canum have a right-handed chirality. This renders them utterly unusable, and certain amino acid combinations can trigger allergic reactions and even anaphylactic shock.

However, as a result of this difference, Terran crops fare remarkably-well, making this world the breadbasket of the French Arm. Food exports are a major industry, though mining and even tourism are likewise important. There are three human colonies on Betan Canum, along with an ESA protectorate and an enclave of the alien Pentapods.

**French Continent UCP:** A976744-C N Ri Hi 3A  
*Nationality: France*  
The French colony on Beta Canum is a very pleasant place, with a patchwork of farms around every city and industrial regions kept far from the cities. This colony is the agricultural mainstay of the entire French Arm, using the beanstalk to cheaply export foodstuffs to many worlds. It is the only site off Earth to have a full-fledged Beanstalk, one of only two in Human Space.

**The Beanstalk**  
The first operational Beanstalk in human space became operational on Beta Canum in 2291. Although its history was marred by an accident in 2293, when 40 capsules fell off the track, the Beanstalk has greatly-benefited all of the colonies on Beta Canum.

**The Pentapod Enclave:** In 2261, the Pentapods made a request to build an enclave on the French Continent's western shore. That request was quickly approved by all ESA governments, in the desire to establish stronger ties with this strange species of bioengineers. Pentapods, being amphibians, are equally at home in all the three environments encompassed by the enclave: underwater, dry and mixed. Humans gain greater respect from the Pentapods by braving the wet rooms when dealing with the aliens.

**German Continent UCP:** C257747-B Ri Hi 1B  
*Nationality: German*  
Although largely equatorial, much of the German colony lies at a higher altitude than New Africa and so is more temperate. Mining is the principal industry of this colony, with enough agriculture to support the primary needs of the population, although some products need to be imported from other colonies. Relations with the French colony are strained in the aftermath of the War of German Reunification on Earth.

**New Africa UCP:** B887745-B Ri Hi 1C  
*Nationality: British*  
New Africa is still instrumental in shipping goods back and forth across the continent and on to markets in the German and French colonies. Tourism is the continent's most important industry, with agriculture a distant second. Lives here are pleasant and largely rural. New Africa straddles the equator and is the smallest full colony on the planet.

### Joi

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Name | 61 Ursae Majoris |

| Survival | DM+0 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Minimal, airborne irritants and allergens.

Joi, 61 Ursae Majoris III, is the single human-habitable planet in the 61 Ursae Majoris system. It is one of the most Earth-like of the colony planets settled to date. Native crops are considered suitable for human consumption but the colonists have found the relatively less advanced ecosphere of Joi simply cannot compete with plants introduced from off-world. Although ecologists have issued dire warnings, there are two colonies – Azania's and Japan's – which have mounted large-scale importation of such crop seeds. Plans to do the same in Elysia were one of the factors in their break with the French government.

**Halbinsel UCP:** C265668-9 N NA In 3C  
*Nationality: German*  
The French may have been the first to survey Joi but the Hanoverians were the first to actually put in a colony. The colonial government operates with a typically German efficiency. There is very little input from the colonists themselves; they answer to an Earth-appointed governor who has some very large – indeed sometimes totally impractical – quotas and schedules to meet. Although there has been grumbling about that, the colonists are also eager to show their support for the new unified German government, which was spearheaded by Hanover.

**Elysia UCP:** D656645-9 Ag Ri 2C  
*Nationality: Independent*  
France arrived on Joi less than a decade after the Germans, settling on the micro-continent of Elysia. In 2285, long-standing grievances between the colonists and the French government erupted into violence. An environmental demonstration turned ugly when a young French lieutenant panicked and ordered his troops to open fire. Although the casualties were light, the event nonetheless incited the population into rebellion. Six years later, the rebels were in charge and France was in retreat.

To outsiders, Elysia always seems on the verge of collapse and indeed it still isn't completely stable. This impression is certainly encouraged by French officials and news media, to the extent that few news agencies will report anything other than the French version of events in their former colony.

**New Cornwall UCP:** C2786565-A Ag Ri 3C  
*Nationality: British*  
New Cornwall is the most advanced of the colonies on Joi. Britain committed to a slow, steady build-up of this colony, through a series of carefully-planned stages. It remained neutral during the Elysian War of Independence, although Britain is a putative ally of France. In addition to its agricultural exports, New Cornwall has started producing durable consumer goods, using spun glass and foamed orbital steel. These have been well-received across the French Arm and are even exported to Earth, despite the high colonial import taxes.

**Tosashimizu UCP:** C247665-9 N Ag Ri 2B  
*Nationality: Japanese*  
Japan settled Joi in 2257, shortly after the British arrived and in contrast to the slow but steady build-up of the British, chose to commit to a massive effort. Their expansion has been quite aggressive and they were the first to introduce Terran crops and livestock on a large scale. This caused quite an uproar amongst environmental groups but the Japanese were undeterred. During the Elysian War, the Japanese offered support to French forces, although the offer was declined. To this day it is thought that the Japanese have territorial designs on the former French colony.

**Lubumbashi UCP:** D32544-9 0 Ag Ri 3C  
*Nationality: Azanian*  
Lubumbashi, the youngest of the Joi colonies, is an Azanian settlement founded in 2280. It has recently reached self-sufficiency in food production and a few luxury crops can be exported to other colonies on Joi or off-world. Like all Azanian colonies, the legal system is kept as minimal as possible, with little interference in peoples' lives, aside from the provision of some medical and social services. The various settlements are widely scattered, with transportation being largely by airship than an expensive ground-based infrastructure like roads or rail.

### Crater

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Minimal, airborne irritants and allergens.

This world's namesake is a massive 1,600 kilometre diameter impact crater in the southern hemisphere. The impact must have blasted away much of the world's atmosphere and wiped out nearly 90% of the plant and animal life on the world. The planetoid fragment that struck had an unusually high concentration of radioactives and other heavy elements and so although the rest of the planet is largely worthless in terms of natural resources, the area of the impact crater is extremely rich. The bottom of the impact crater itself is covered with a network of lakes and swamps and it is uncomfortably hot. The only comfortable area within the crater is the mountain at its centre, the result of up-wellings after the initial impact.

**Crater (colony) UCP:** D225664-9 0 Po 5B  
*Nationality: British*  
The colony on Crater consists of two groups, the ranchers and farmers of the Highlands, and the miners who work the crater. The highlanders have been adapted to the thin air and dry (although not desert) conditions, while the miners must contend with the heat and much thicker atmosphere at the bottom of the crater. The result is two different populations who share the colony but cannot interbreed without medical intervention. Crater lacks the necessary expertise for that, a situation that many feel is deliberate. The Chartered Crater Company runs the planet on a long-term lease from the British home office. There is considerable labour unrest in the colony, especially among the miners.

### Adlerhorst

| Gravity | 1.16G (normal) |
| Survival | DM+0 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Various allergens and mineral salts.

Adlerhorst is a comfortable world towards the end of the French Arm, on a dead-end finger. This rugged planet supports a very diverse ecosystem, from the bottom of the oceans to the tops of the highest peaks. Most of this biological wealth is fully compatible with human dietary requirements, requiring only a few trace elements and vitamin K. Unfortunately, humans are likewise eminently digestible to most of the world's predators.

One of the most unique features of Adlerhorst is the domination of the two pseudo-avian animal groups over the other animal types in the eco-system. Unlike the birds of Earth, the Tomavians ('almost birds') and Xenoavians (strange birds) have largely kept their teeth and many have manipulatory appendages at the carpal joints of their wing-like forelimbs.

**New Mark UCP:** D546645-9 0 Ag 5 C  
*Nationality: German*  
The Bavarians were the first to settle this rich world and made the most of their colony, despite the distance from earth. It is primarily an agricultural settlement and much of the work is still done with animals and brute force methods. Nonetheless, it is a highly-productive colony and shipments of luxury foodstuffs and some wonderful beers are commonly exported. During the War of German reunification, tensions ran very high on this world. An abortive attack on the world's sole spaceport by German ultra-nationalists enflamed the passions into open warfare. By the end of the war on Earth, a multi-national peacekeeping force had intervened on Adlerhorst, restoring some semblance of peace to the planet. While led by Britain, the force included substantial numbers of American and Australians. Tensions still run high, however, and the Germans are not well-disposed to the peace-keepers, whom they see as French allies and conspirators. Only the Australians are seen by the Germans as being relatively-impartial.

**Saint-Benoit UCP:** D556645-9 M Ag 4 C  
*Nationality: French*  
The French colony was settled well over a decade after the Bavarian colony but France poured more resources into the colony in an attempt to upstage the Bavarian effort. While the colony certainly has more industry than its rival and the farming efforts are much more advanced, it has yet to attain the sort of export success enjoyed by its neighbour. The current tensions are exacerbated by a combination of a sense of betrayal, as until recently the French and Bavarians had been close allies, and the sort of rage that comes from being beaten by an inferior opponent. French citizens are still smarting from the defeat experienced during the War of German Reunification and are not liable to soon forget it.

### Nous Voilà

| Survival | DM+0 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Some allergen issues. No PAS issue.

Nous Voilà's climate was not always as temperate as it is today. When explorers first discovered it, it had an adequate atmosphere but was cold, with ice caps covering most of the planet's surface and holding most of the available water. Native life was adapted to this temperature, with hardy plants and a few small sea creatures but no land animals.

Using a variety of techniques, France terraformed the world over the course of two decades, raising the world's climate from Cold to Temperate. This required a variety of technologies from solettas (giant mirrors) in orbit to genetically-engineered micro-organisms and plants. Once the temperature was raised to acceptable levels, the micro-organisms were eliminated. The world was quarantined for another six years to prevent the undesired contamination of other worlds before the microorganisms were totally destroyed.

Over the course of only a few decades, Nous Voilà had shifted from a frozen, barren world into a garden ready for planting. Nous Voilà's terrestrial biology is now almost entirely Terran, with some forms allowed to run free, notably mule deer, grey wolves and European bison.

**Nous Voilà UCP:** D546645-9 0 Ag 5 C  
*Nationality: French*  
Nous Voilà is a pleasant colony world characterised by scattered villages and productive farms. The first settlers were from French Africa, primarily Cameroon and Senegal. Later colonists followed from continental France, fleeing the latest round of government obtrusiveness and the tightening of the surveillance loop. Recently, the colonists have been allowed to hunt the various Terran animals released into the wild, although only in limited numbers. There is a lottery to determine who has hunting rights for a season; these rights can be sold and often for very high prices, especially to off-worlders.

### Dunkelheim

| Gravity | 0.6G (low) |
| Survival | DM-2 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Extremely dry. Kamelinsekten swarms are indirectly dangerous.

Dunkelheim is a near-desert world in the outer reaches of the French Arm. Agriculture is difficult at best but the world is a rich source of valuable ores. Much of the world's surface water is locked up in kamelinsekten hives, vast honeycombs of tiny chambers that soak up water like a rocky sponge. Due to some relatively recent environmental catastrophe, the kamelinsekten have no natural predators. They have a tendency to swarm whenever they leave a nest and a swarm can injure or even kill unprotected humans and their animals. Individually or in small flights, however, the cicada-sized kamelinsekten are relatively-harmless.

**Dunkelheim UCP:** D254644-A 0 NI Po 5B  
*Nationality: German*  
Dunkelheim is a fairly unpleasant world and served for a time as a Bavarian penal colony. At the time of colonisation, Bavaria and several of her terrestrial allies were having a problem with vice crime. The Bavarian treasury was strained by the effort of incarcerating these people but at the same time the Bavarians needed colonists for an unpleasant but mineral-rich world that had just opened up on the edge of the frontier: Dunkelheim. These two problems were solved in one stroke and convicts with useful skills were given the choice of long prison terms or deportation to Dunkelheim.

The current society celebrates this notorious past and is very libertarian as a result.

### Hochbaden

| Survival | DM+0 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Vacuum World. Pressure suits required for surface.

Hochbaden is defined as a desert world. It has a very thin atmosphere, which can cause erosion and occasional dust storms but cannot support human life. Aside from some micro-organisms found around the fringes of poles, Hochbaden is lifeless. Even those microbes are presumed to have been transplanted here by a meteor strike, since they probably could not have evolved under these conditions. Hochbaden has been likened to Mars in many scientific circles.

**Hochbaden UCP:** C228648-C N Va NI 6B  
*Nationality: German*  
Hochbaden is a collection of surface domes and space stations in an otherwise uninhabitable system. Mining on the surface is supported by extensive gardens and recreation facilities in orbit. Most of the current surface facilities are intended for temporary habitation but the current round of construction is aimed at creating extensive surface arcologies that blend in with the environment, yet allow comfortable human habitation. There are rumours that the German government is seeking to lift the moratorium on DNA modification research so that they can examine the possibility of engineering colonists to a better fit with Hochbaden's surface conditions. This would presumably be accompanied by some manner of terraforming to actually add oxygen to the thin atmosphere.

### Aurore

| Gravity | 0.73G (low) |
| Survival | DM-2 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Sudden storms, high tides, incompatible biosphere, toxic (and poisonous) life forms, alien invaders.

Most of the plants and animals on Aurore are actively poisonous and at best simply provide no nutritional value. Auroran life is based on right-handed amino acids and thus unusable. Many animals also secrete acid, which is usually more dangerous as a systemic poison than for any corrosive effects.

The human colonies on Aurore have been steadily replacing the native life in selected areas with imported Earth crops. Where terrestrial strains have grown wild in places, they have generally failed in competition with native Auroran forms and colony farms must be carefully and patiently worked to maintain the balance of their miniature and artificial terrestrial ecosystems. Auroran soil is incapable of supporting Terran life and must be carefully sterilised and cultured before human crops can be grown.

**Novoa Kyev UCP:** X325600-8 0 Po 2 0 X  
*Nationality: Ukrainian*  
The Ukrainians were the first settlers of this world and originally the entire planet was named Novoa Kiyev. However, the colony failed to perform as expected and they nearly defaulted on loans and guarantees provided by the ESA to support their colonisation attempt. They since managed to get caught up, only to suffer the full brunt of the alien invasion in 2298. The colony was devastated and is currently occupied by tens of thousands of alien troops. Conditions within the colony are said to be critical but it is isolated on the far side of the planet from the other two colonies and no help is available.

**Aurore UCP:** D135664-A Po 5 0 C  
*Nationality: French*  
The French colony was started after the colonial administration of Novoya Kiyev failed to make good on mineral shipments and other supply contracts. France decided that it would be better to establish their own colony on this distant world. Like the other colonies, they suffered at the hands of the alien invasion force. The French colony was the best prepared of the three colonies, having started reinforcing the local garrison after the abortive contact attempt at Station Arcture in 2295. Even so, the colony took extensive damage and roving bands of Kaefers still attack outlying villages.

**Tanstaafl UCP:** D436641-9 M Po 5 0 C  
*Nationality: Independent*  
The youngest of the colonies on Aurore, Tanstaafl is also one of only a handful of off-world independent nations in human space. When the original cartel that settled the colony defaulted and disbanded, the local settlers took matters into their own hands and declared independence in 2259. When the alien Kaefers invaded, Tanstaafl had no military or defensive forces, aside from the Tanstaafl Rural Police. Initial losses were extremely high among colonists and the police who struggled to save them. The local government immediately contacted a RebCo SAR factor in neighbouring Hochbaden, begging for mercenaries. Two months later, the core of what would become the Tanstaafl Free Legion arrived on planet, 12 hardened mercenaries from Punjab, who formed the training cadre for the new force. Two months after that, equipped with surplus armoured vehicles from Adlerhorst, they began pushing the aliens back.

### Exploratory and Undeveloped Worlds

#### Sans Souci

| Attribute | Value |

| Primary Name | DM+36 2219 |
| Stellar Coordinates | -27.9, 1.2, 19.9 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Extreme cold, some pathogens.

Sans Souci is a cold and barren world, similar in many ways to Beta Comae Berenices before it was terraformed. The scientists and engineers who form the crew of main outpost are convinced that with a little help, Sans Souci could be a welcoming world. Sans Souci has long languished as nothing more than a large outpost. French ambitions lay elsewhere and neither the military junta nor the Empire that replaced it cared to lay out the resources required to turn Sans Souci into a full-fledged colony. Oddly enough, the Life Foundation supports the idea of Sans Souci being colonised.

#### Labyrinth

| Primary Name | DM+10 2531 |
| Stellar Coordinates | -39.6, -13.3, 7.1 |

| UPP | X7E1000-0 S 252 85 |
| Gravity | 0.67G (low) |
| Survival | N/A |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Extreme cold, some pathogens.

The distant world sometimes called Labyrinth is a cool, mountainous world with extensive tectonic activity. The thin atmosphere is only breathable at very low altitudes and the 1,800 kilometres trench system of Grossartige Senke provides the lowest terrain on the planet, up to 4,500 metres below the effective surface. Pressure is nearly normal at the bottom of the trench and almost all the world's water rests here as well. This trench system, along with many others, supports a well-developed biosphere, with some of the vaguely insectoid animals reaching lengths of three to four metres.

The bottom of the Grossartige Senke is in near-total darkness almost all of the time, shaded by the towering canyon walls, and the local life has evolved to meet the challenge of these conditions. There are no plants, although something much like a fungus flourishes near the volcanic vents. The basis of the food-chain in the trench is not plants but large colonies of chemosynthetic bacteria that cluster around the many volcanic vents and geysers that line the floor of the canyon. As a by-product of their metabolism, they produce large amounts of oxygen.

Both the nation of Freihafen, which surveyed the world, and the powerful colony on Nibelungen, are looking at Labyrinth as a possible colony world. It has exploitable resources and would establish both nations/colonies as serious players on the international scale.

## The Manchurian Arm

The Manchurian Arm begins at Delta Pavonis and extends in two directions. One reaches to Beta Hydri, Zeta Tucanae, Rho Eridani and 82 Eridani, all prime colonisation territory. The other reaches through two red dwarf systems (Xiuning and Hunjiang) to the garden worlds of Tau Ceti, Epsilon Eridani and Omicron2 Eridani.

Exploration and settlement of the arm proceeded smoothly until the establishment of an outpost at DM+1 4774 in 2247. Shortly thereafter, a Manchurian exploratory mission was sent to DM+4 123 and returned with the electrifying news that the star system was inhabited by an indigenous intelligent species, the first to be encountered by humanity. Most nations of the Earth hastened to open a variety of diplomatic and cultural contacts with the species the Manchurians named the Sung (in common with all intelligent species encountered by humanity, their own name for themselves, Ak-char'al-woon, translates roughly as 'thinking being'). The discovery of another intelligent species in the Stark system, enslaved by the Sung, led directly to the Slaver War, where Manchurian and Canadian forces decimated the Sung fleet and freed the peaceful inhabitants of the garden moon.

During this same period (the mid-23rd century), explorers and colonists in the Beta Hydri branch of the Manchurian Arm discovered the ruins of a technological society, later determined to be a colony established some 4,000 years previous. Another ruined colony was found at Rho Eridani later.

A few years later, an exploratory mission of the United Arab Republic visited 82 Eridani and discovered the Ebers. Considerably less advanced than humankind, the Ebers were nevertheless open to limited contact. Since then, two major colonial enclaves have been established on Kormoran, the Eber homeworld.

Colonisation of the Manchurian Arm has, overall, been very successful and there are plenty of systems that have yet to be explored and colonised. Terrorist actions have long been a problem on the Manchurian Arm with a wide variety of groups claiming responsibility, from the universal scapegoat of ProVolution to such fringe groups as the Daughters of Mao. These attacks tend to be small and localised, although there are indications that something big is going to happen soon. Of course, people have been saying that for 20 years.

Life on the worlds of the Manchurian Arm tends to be rougher than the other Arms. The longer distances involved in the twisting routes of this Arm mean fewer trips, with priority going more to colonists and animals than to heavy equipment and infrastructure. There is much more reliance on animal power on the worlds of the Manchurian Arm, especially the Manchurian colony worlds, which see the lowest level of infrastructure support and are expected to succeed under primitive conditions with little aid from the mother country. The Inca Republic is in largely the same situation, without even the limited resources available to the Manchurians. Their success is largely due to their tendency to piggy-back on Texan colonies.

**The Canadian Finger:** Canadian explorers were the first to chart the system of DM+20 5046 (Kanata), a distant but attractive system. In order to support a colonisation effort, Canada found it necessary to establish a series of outposts (DM+19 5116 and DM+15 4733) to service ships traveling there. The series of systems is called the Canadian Finger. The finger also leads to Eriksson, a relatively pleasant planet at AC+17 534105. Canada, the Scandinavian Union and an alliance of five major Sung nations are looking at colonising efforts.

**The Latin Finger:** Extending from Epsilon Eridani is a finite branch that reaches as far as Procyon before dead-ending. Paradoxically, the route to Procyon (so very close to Earth) is one of the longest in general use. The expedition to colonise Omicron2 Eridani was jointly funded and supported by Mexico and Argentina, and the world is a gateway to the Latin worlds: DM-3 1123 (the Inca Republic, Texas and the Life Foundation) and Procyon (Brazil).

### Cold Mountain

| Distance from Earth | 18.68 light years |
| UPP | C6D766-8 R 465 A6 |
| Gravity | 0.83G (normal) |
| Survival | DM-3 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
High partial-pressure of oxygen, extremely dangerous and aggressive life forms.

Technically, Cold Mountain is a garden world but its human inhabitants would hardly agree. It combines an oxygen content high enough to be lethal at low altitudes with an ecosphere that seems hell-bent on eating every last colonist. These animals are so dangerous that the colonists have taken to calling them 'Yāo mó', or 'demons'.

**Han Shan (Cold Mountain) UCP:** D253746-8 0 Po 1 0 B  
*Nationality: Manchurian*  
Colonisation of Cold Mountain was costly. Over half of the original 12,000 settlers were lost to local dangers. But this was Manchuria's first colony world and every effort was made to make certain it survived, even at a severe cost to the Manchurian homeland. New colonists were sent to replace those killed and to broaden the population base. To this day, Manchuria supports a strong emigration policy to Cold Mountain. The prospects are tempting enough for would-be colonists to ignore the inherent dangers. This strategy has prevented the development of local dialects, while strengthening planet-wide gratitude toward, and honouring of, Manchuria.

**Proper Cold Mountain Attire**  
Normal outdoor clothing on Cold Mountain is a lightweight but thick suit with metal reinforcement at vulnerable areas. Headwear is a padded hood, along with a large, conical metal hat to protect the head and shoulders from attack by blinds or razor flies. A fine mesh made of metal links hangs down from the hat to drape across the shoulders as further protection. All footwear has metal inserts in the sole of the boot, rendering them somewhat inflexible but immune to sandworms and screwworms.

- Weight: 5kg
- Protection: 3 (full protection against demon attacks and other bladed weapons)
- Price: Lv75
- All citizens over the age of 10 are encouraged to carry the local long sword or long-bladed spear.

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Higher mean temperature than Earth, numerous highly-specialised predatory forms, allergens and irritants in the atmosphere.

**The Ruins:** In 2249, the ruins of an ancient technological culture was discovered near the Arabian colony. This was evidence for a second interstellar civilisation, although the ruins had been abandoned for at least a few thousand years. Further evidence for this civilisation was found on Heidelshiemat in 2253, and in 2256, the Ebers, who had colonised those worlds thousands of years ago, were first contacted on a planet orbiting 82-Eridani. Study of the ruins is ongoing and even with live Ebers to study on Kormoran, new discoveries are being made at both ruins sites on Beta Hydri.

| Gravity | 0.44G (low) |
| Survival | DM-1 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Lower than normal partial-pressure of oxygen, airborne contaminants in spring and fall, largely incompatible biospheres.

With an axial tilt of 13.3º, seasonal variation of the hours of daylight on Heidelsheimat is not as great as on Earth. The differences in temperature between winter and summer on Heidelsheimat are also less pronounced than on Earth, giving rise to a more temperate climate in general at the middle latitudes.

Life on Heidelsheimat has evolved to levels of complexity comparable to those on Earth. Much of the land-based life takes advantage of Heidelsheimat's low gravity and comparatively dense atmosphere, and are either gliders or true flyers. Some of the gliders, like the Sky Jumper, leap from a height, either a tree or cliff, while other, like the bush bunnies, leap three to four metres into the air and glide from there. Though Terran and Heidelsheimatian biologies are incompatible, some of the local wildlife has been known to gorge on Human crops, only to die of starvation with their bellies full.

**Heidelsheimat UCP:** D676745-B N Ri, Hi 1C  
*Nationality: German*  
The first colony established on the world that would be called Heidelshiemat, the Bavarian settlement concentrated on resource development and industrial production. Buoyed by their successes, they even placed an outpost at DM-56 328, making it the only one of national colonies with a colony of its own. Since the War of German Reunification, the colony's leadership has been divided on the question of joining the new nation or going it on their own. Germany has been exerting a great deal of pressure on the colony but Heidelshiemat is one of the few colonies with the ability to make it on their own.

**Alamo UCP:** D364623-A 0 Ri 3C  
*Nationality: Texan*  
The year 2244 saw the arrival of a Texan expedition and the establishment of a Texan outpost on a continent well away from the one that the Bavarians settled on. Intending the outpost to be a stepping stone to the 82 Eridani system (still unexplored), the Texans moved in without giving the Bavarians much advance notice, nor even really asking their permission. Although the Bavarians had no really good reason for trying to keep the Texans off Heidelsheimat, the fact of the Texans moving in so blithely without consulting the Bavarians left a bad feeling in the minds of many of the Bavarian colonists. Consequently, the Bavarian colony does its best to keep contact with the Texans to the barest minimum.

**Pachamama UCP:** D552658-8 0 Ri 1C  
*Nationality: Incan*  
The first Incan pre-colonisation expedition arrived in 2280. Ill-equipped to perform much in the way of useful surveys, the Incans found that they had to call on the Texans for equipment and aid. The Texans provided both on the condition that such assistance was temporary. The Incans set about selecting a site for their colony in an area well to the north of the Texan colony. By 2289 the colony was formally-established, despite it being little more than an outpost with a large spaceport at this time. The Incans were still forced to rely heavily on the Texans for technical support. The Texans grudgingly acquiesced, although the feeling was that the Incas should be able to do the work themselves. The Incan colony does not make use of DNA modifications, though the PEA-specific mod for this world was developed before the Moratorium.

**Eber Ruins**  
In 2253, a group of Texan explorers scouting out the region to the south of their outpost discovered what appeared to be ruins of a sentient culture. Although the remains on the ground were little more than rubble, orbital surveys showed recognisably artificial foundation patterns. Further research, and comparison with the ruins on Daikoku, showed the Rho Eridani ruins to have been built by the same culture: The Ebers. Although the ruins were demonstrably Eber, there are marked differences between the Daikoku and Rho Eridani sites, most notably in the layout and the artefacts so far discovered. The current hypothesis is that the two worlds were settled by different Eber groups, perhaps different nations.

### Chengdu

| Survival | DM-2 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
Lower than normal partial-pressure of oxygen, airborne contaminants in spring and fall, largely incompatible biospheres.

Chengdu is similar to Earth in many ways, although the land is more rugged and the weather is more mild. While the world has a somewhat higher gravity than Earth, and is somewhat cooler, it has a great potential as a colony and a provider of resources for the sponsoring nations and foundations. The presence of free organic radicals in the atmosphere constitutes a minor taint but one that is easily handled by Filtration Symbionts or filter masks.

**Chengdu UCP:** C275745-B N Ri, In 2 0 C  
*Nationality: Manchuria, Canada, Nigeria, Life Foundation*  
Colonisation of Chengdu occurred in two phases. The first phase, centred on what is now the city of Anyou, was dedicated to resource exploitation and at first did not include industry or farming. The second phase, centred on the city of Shaoguan, was jointly sponsored by the Manchurian government and the Life Foundation, along with participation by both Canada and Nigeria. It took longer to organise and it was not until 2241 that the first ships carrying the colonists for the new colony arrived. This second phase of the colonisation effort was aimed at providing the more intangible elements of a successful community, such as a university, along with manufacturing and farming. After 112 years, the colony is fully self-sufficient and has an economy equal to most Tier 3 nations. There is a large independence movement, which has led to large demonstrations on several occasions. However, Manchuria is not about to let go of its most successful colony and only the presence of Canadian and Nigerian nationals has prevented the Manchurian colonial government from cracking down harshly on the independence movement. Even then, there are numerous stories of pro-independence people 'disappearing' or being arrested by Manchurian authorities. Despite the occasional heavy-handedness of the Manchurians, the colonies are known for their relatively open governments, particularly when compared to other Manchurian colonies.

**Religion in the Colonies**  
On many colony worlds, religion serves a two-fold purpose. One is purely religious but the other, and often more important, purpose is social. In many small communities, the church has once again become the social centre of life, with dinners, dances and socials providing a means for neighbours to get to know one another. Religion in remote areas tends to be more ecumenical as well, with the question of denomination, or even faith, seldom coming up.

### Austin's World

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Name | DM-3 1123 |

| UPP | D989674-B R 363 A 8 |
| Gravity | 1.25G (high) |
| Survival | DM-1 |

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**  
High gravity, allergens, variable day/night cycles.

Austin's World has an extreme axial tilt of almost 90°. This has the planet passing from pointing one pole at the sun for several days at a time, as it swings around to point the other pole at the sun. The uneven heating of the opposite poles produces violent winds that shift directions approximately every 20 days, with frequent heavy rains. The slightly thick atmosphere packs a lot of kinetic energy and can flatten transplanted Terran crops or trees in unprotected areas.

All forms of Austinian sea life are edible by humans, although some are scarcely palatable. The aforementioned seaweed is the tastiest of the vegetables and visitors to the world have spoken highly of one of the bottom-feeders. Colonists, especially of the Life Foundation, have learned to relish most of the possible foods from the sea. However, the only source of vitamin C is Earth fruits.

Most agriculture is carried out in heavily-built greenhouses and utilises soil which has been enriched with Terran bacteria. Orchards are shielded by rock walls in all directions, so the landscape from the air looks like a set of postal cubbyholes. Grains and other grasses have been engineered to have shorter, stronger stems to survive the occasional cold spells and high winds.

**Cousteau UCP:** D279520-B R Ri 5C  
*Nationality: Life Foundation*  
The Life Foundation Colony is located in the islands off the coast of New Travis, several hundred kilometres from the Texan and Inca colonies. It is the first full colony constructed by the Life Foundation, although they have several outposts and enclaves across human space. It was constructed as an experiment in ocean living and farming techniques. It is also notable as the home of the only off-earth population of uplifted dolphins, with nearly 200 resident in and around the colony. While distrustful of humans, they are working well with the Life Foundation idealists at Couteau.

**Day or Night**  
The day/night cycle on Austin's World is quite variable and is extremely difficult for people to adapt their circadian rhythms to this world. As a result, the colonists use a great deal of artificial light and create their own schedules, often around a 28-hour cycle.

**Trinity Flats UCP:** D364643-8 N Ri 3 0 B  
*Nationality: Texan*  
Texan colonists are spread along the western coastal plain of the world's one continent. Two major population centres, Travisville and Crockett City, house heavy industry and orbital interface facilities. Much of this industry relies on imported equipment since there are few metals suitable for making factory machinery on Austin's World. A power network distributes electricity from the Life Foundation's powersat and from several small hydroelectric dams. The orbital catapult lies directly on the equator. A sizeable ground terminal has been built to accommodate freight awaiting shipment. Treaties with the Incan Republic and the Life Foundation guarantee access to the orbital facilities.

**Sechura UCP:** E53345A-6 0 Ag NI 4D  
*Nationality: Incan Republic*  
The Incans inhabit the highlands and valleys in the centre of New Tarrant. Snow and ice are common in the world's short winter. Roads to connect the valleys have been constructed and a power net, with huge arrays of solar cells, supplies some of the power, the rest being purchased from the powersat. The major trade items produced here are minerals for fertiliser and the chemical industries, along with light-element ores, used for export to Earth as well as being an on-planet trade item. Like many new colonies, the Incas make extensive use of animal power, which exist alongside Link phones and hydrogen-powered heavy machinery.

Much of the Eriksson's water is locked up in the large dark-side icecap. This small world is tidally-locked to its primary and orbits quite closely in. This makes it susceptible to flare activity but the red dwarf star it orbits seems to be unusually stable. The planet's magnetic field would help attenuate any radiation but being on the surface during a flare would be dangerous.

**Environmental Hazard and Requirements:**

Almost entirely covered by water, this world has baffled Manchurian planners for decades. There are resources there but exploiting them would require a different approach than any other Manchurian colony. This tidally-locked world orbits close to its primary and the temperature differential between the hot and cold sides of the planet keep a steady stream of hurricane-sized storms blowing across the equatorial regions from the cold side to the hot side.

## Organisations

Beyond the governments of the Core nations and colonies, a variety of other powerful entities drive their own agendas. Foundations, Corporations, Terrorists and Criminal Groups influence the daily lives of millions of people.

### Foundations

Foundations are not governments, yet fulfil governmental responsibilities in some places and for some people. They are independent and well-financed, yet rely on public support and opinion to perform their role. Foundations are rigorously administered to ensure they perform their tasks properly and their finances are a matter of public record. Public trust for the Foundations is high, as even those with agendas have obvious and popular ones.

Some Foundations support research, while others support colonisation efforts. Some are public service organisations, while others have clearly stated nationalist goals. All exist across borders and nationalities, and may have the same extrality protections offered to TransNats and diplomatic personnel.

Foundations and their activities cover the entire spectrum of human activity. The background, interests and motivations of each foundation varies greatly.

#### Astronomischen Rechen-Institut

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Heidelberg, Germany, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** The pursuit of pure research into stars, planets and astronomical processes
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Knowledge, colonial surveys, starship design
- **LANGUAGE(S):** German, French, English
- **CULTURE:** Open, similar to a university
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 42,000+ students and interns
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Primarily the French Arm and distant expeditions

The Bavarian Astronomischen Rechen-Institut was originally part of the University of Heidelberg. Endowed by Azania with tantalum and funding to support a squadron of interstellar scouts, the ARI is a foundation pursuing pure research into the nature of stars and their planetary systems.

The ARI sponsors exploratory missions to strange star systems and phenomena. Most are directed at the immediate Frontier systems but there are several expeditions operating beyond 50 light-years from Sol, some of which are not expected to return for more than a decade. One of these, the Swabia, is feared lost after it ventured past Arcturus in 2294.

Missions for the Astronomischen Rechen-Institut will usually be purely exploratory. This might be anything from a voyage to an interesting stellar body to the search for, and exploration of, colonisable planets. First priority in these missions is the acquisition of new knowledge, although often with an eye to exploiting that knowledge for the benefit of the ARI.

#### The Life Foundation

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Isle of Summer, Wellon, Tirane, Alpha Centauri, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** To promote colonisation efforts
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Colony planning, infrastructure design, transportation
- **LANGUAGE(S):** Esperanto, English, Spanish
- **CULTURE:** Open, forward-thinking, idealistic
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 8,000 at headquarters, another 17,000 throughout human space, plus personnel on Austin's World
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** All of human space but concentrated on the Latin Finger of the Manchurian Arm

**Copyright and Patent Rights**  
Foundations and Corporations are vitally concerned with the issue of copyrights and patents, for this is what their fortunes are made on. Most governments enforce limits on copyrights and patents, however, with copyrights expiring after 20 years and patents after 10. The government's reasoning is that these periods are sufficient to accrue a reasonable profit and pay for development costs, without stifling further innovation. Some nations, like Indonesia and the Inca Republic, however, do not recognise international copyright and patent law at all.

Devoted to colonisation, and increasingly to humanitarian efforts, the Life Foundation had its beginnings in the initial colonisation efforts of Alpha Centauri. Grants are provided to willing and talented individuals who wish to colonise other worlds but who might otherwise not have been able to do so due to national or economic considerations. In its beginning years, the Life Foundation was at the service of nations seeking particular individuals and skills in short supply.

The Foundation also has large monetary resources, which are used to transport colonists who do not qualify for government-sponsored resettlement. The Life Foundation promotes colonisation throughout human space, although it has a definite bias in the types of colonies supported. Only colonies on worlds where humans can survive without off-world assistance are considered and to this end the Life Foundation was a big proponent of DNA modification procedures until the Moratorium. Even then, they continued to make the case for genetic engineering of colonists, despite the unpopularity of that position on the Core worlds.

The Life Foundation is the leading proponent of the Soft Path to colonisation and its greatest achievement has been its colonisation effort on DM-3 1123 (Austin's World) on the route from Montana (Omicron2 Eridani) to Procyon (far along the Manchurian Arm) – an effort accomplished using solely the Foundation's assets.

Its current major project is the construction of two deep-space stations to create a bridge between Earth and the far end of the Manchurian Arm. Built in cooperation with the governments of Texas and Brazil, these stations are being built with first generation stutterwarp tuning systems, allowing tug operations. The stations, located between Earth and the outpost at Qingyuan (UV Ceti B) are expected to come online with the next five years and could cut months off transit time from Earth to the Latin Finger, not to mention many other worlds deep in the Manchurian Arm. This route is the most advantageous for all colonies along the arm and so furthers the Foundation's goal most effectively. However, many outposts and the Manchurian colony at Cold Mountain stand to lose considerable trade if the short cut proves viable.

Missions for the Life Foundation will focus on new colonisation efforts. This does not always mean new worlds, however, as it is often as difficult a job to begin a colony on a new continent as on a new planet.

#### North American Research League

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Vancouver, Canada, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** To prevent the ravaging of any ecosystem and promote peaceful interactions between nations, cultures and species
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Environmental assessment, alternative technologies
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English, French, many others
- **CULTURE:** Open but somewhat paranoid at the same time, very sceptical of governments and, in particular, of large corporations
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 10,000+ throughout human space, along with millions of supporters mostly in the Core
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Throughout human space

The name 'North American' was derived from the chief source of charitable support for the organisation at its conception. Today the League enjoys interstellar support of its activities to keep planetary ecologies safe from overexploitation and the mediation of national disputes. Although sometimes employing unorthodox tactics, the League and its far-flung membership can be found pursuing peaceful solutions to critical situations in all corners of human space. Most of their support, however, comes from the Core and it is there that the Foundation's policies are decided. Their most notable operation was their successful mobilisation of world opinion to free the Xiang slaves from the Sung.

Missions for NARL are usually begun by whatever local personnel discover the problem, augmented by freelance troubleshooters. For this reason, the organisation keeps a file of expert agents for hire who can be trusted to travel to the location and solve the problem in a manner approved by NARL headquarters. These agents often face personal danger but reap the rewards of travel to exotic places, as well as large expense accounts.

#### Zapamoga

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Gdansk, Poland, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** To provide opportunities for those who lack them to resettle on new worlds in an atmosphere of hope and prosperity
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Colony planning and support, emergency services and aid
- **LANGUAGE(S):** Polish, Russian, English, French, Chinese
- **CULTURE:** Dedicated, driven, orderly
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 110,000 throughout human space
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Human space

Zapamoga was formed in the chaos that followed Twilight, providing assistance and support to refugees in Eastern Europe. The group's mission gradually changed as the organisation transported Europeans to settlements in Africa, Asia and South America and later carried people from Earth to colonies on distant worlds.

Missions for Zapamoga will usually involve transportation of people or goods to a colony site, or as part of a larger effort to provide support and aid in the event of a disaster.

### Minor Foundations

These minor foundations tend to have fewer resources and thus have a smaller scope of interests and areas of operation.

**ACADEMIA DEL LINCEI**  
Based out of Rome, the Academia is focused on the quest for antiquity, its artefacts, its ideals and its knowledge, making it an almost totally Earth-centred foundation. It has a reputation for eccentricity. The Academia does some work on the Manchurian Arm investigating Eber ruins and their ancient artefacts but the activity of greatest interest to many is their catalogue of Unidentified Astronomical Objects, a list of artefacts of unknown, and possibly non-human, construction. While this is out of character with their normal activities, no explanation for this interest has been offered.

**ALBERTA FARMERS' COOPERATIVE**  
Based out of Calgary, Canada, the AFC has a major role in the exploitation of new-found worlds along the Canadian branch of the Manchurian Arm, along with provision of genetically-engineered seed stock and grain supplies to many worlds throughout human space.

**FOUNDATION FOR PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE**  
With its headquarters in Wellon City of Swansea, on Tirane, the Foundation for Practical Knowledge focuses on pure research; anything from ground-based laboratory studies on genetics to maintenance of a data collection facility in an asteroid belt.

**L'INSTITUT DES ETUDES XENOLOGIQUES**  
The IEX, an academic institution funded by the French government, is the foremost organisation on Earth dedicated to studying the diversity of alien life forms, including intelligent life.

**INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE ASTRONOMIA PRACTICA**  
INAP is a joint venture by the governments of Argentina and Mexico, and its activities centre on the exploration of the Montana-Procyon branch of the Manchurian Arm. There are rumours of INAP involvement in more clandestine operations.

**PAIX AVEC LES XENOS**  
PAX is a new organisation that insists all the problems humanity has had with the Kaefers are simply the result of a misunderstanding or human aggression. PAX is extremely unpopular on the French Arm; it receives most of its support from Earth.

**THE ROYAL SOCIETY**  
Chief catalyst in British interstellar activities, the Royal Society has the Royal Family's blessing, the parliamentary government's tolerance and endowments and popular support from all of Britain to promote a variety of colonial and exploratory expeditions on the Frontier.

**THE TRANSHUMAN LEAGUE**  
Just as the terrorist group ProVolution supports the cause of directed human evolution through violence and revolution, the Transhuman League advances it through political action and protest. The chief aim of the League is to restart research in DNA modifications and make the technology legally available everywhere.

### Transnational Corporations

The Transnational Corporations, or TransNats, exist in a legal grey zone. They are nominally based out of one country but the scope of their operations covers many worlds. In these situations, there is a delicate balance between loyalty to nation and loyalty to corporation. As the TransNats expand, and offer greater services and rewards to their employees, this loyalty shifts away from the nation; some TransNats are powerful enough to have colonies and Trilon has laid claim to an entire world. Many TransNats have extrality agreements with the countries in which they have offices and operations, granting corporate enclaves sovereign territory status. TransNats self-police these territories and rarely extradite corporate personnel for anything other than capital crimes, instead simply moving them to another enclave. The host nations tolerate this due to the investments the TransNats make and the jobs they provide to local citizens.

#### Rebco SAR

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Lansdowne, Wellon, Tirane, Alpha Centauri, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** To provide the best and most appropriate human resource to tackle any problem, anywhere
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Employment services, troubleshooting, security and mercenaries
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English, Urdu, French
- **CULTURE:** Free-wheeling but at the same time very cautious. All operations must be above-board
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 125,000 throughout human space, including contractors
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Human Space

In the year 2244, two financial institutions on Earth, the Rawal Pindi Trading Company of Punjab and the National Express Bank of America, merged to become Rebco. The majority of Rebco's business involved financial services on Earth but in 2257, after developing a large internal security force, the corporation created a splinter group dedicated to providing short-term security forces to organisations on colony worlds. This began with uniformed guards for corporations and over time ranged up to include mercenary troops for small colonial governments and even rescue operations.

Rebco relocated their new organisation's offices to the colony of Wellon, on Tirane, and called it Rebco Search and Rescue or, more succinctly, Rebco SAR. Since then, Rebco SAR has expanded from providing security forces to matching persons seeking employment with employers looking for experienced personnel.

Missions for Rebco SAR can involve practically anything. If there is money to be made, Rebco SAR will most likely be willing to get involved, although its coordinators pride themselves upon their honest reputation and avoid overtly criminal activities.

#### Trilon

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Portland, United States, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** Providing the best quality products and services, at a reasonable price, with appropriate rate of return
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Consumer products, computers, starships
- **LANGUAGE:** English
- **CULTURE:** Guarded, somewhat conservative, security-conscious
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 720,000, mostly on Earth and Kie-Yuma
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Core, American Arm, French Arm

Founded in 2167 in the wake of the settlement of Alpha Centauri, Trilon has grown from a starship maintenance company to the largest private starship construction firm in human space. From that core business, Trilon is now one of the largest corporations in human space, with extensive Earthside and colonial holdings. Trilon's consumer products division makes everything from kitchen utensils to auto-building houses and Trilon products can be found in virtually every home across the American Arm and the Core.

In the mid 2200's they began settling the French Arm world of Kie-Yuma, using their resources to initiate a large-scale terraforming project. After 40 years, the atmosphere is breathable with only a filter mask and protective suit, and within 20 years neither should be necessary.

## Other Large Corporations and Transnationals

- **Aberdeen Mineral Exploitation Company (AMEC):** Mining, investments
- **Aerotech SA:** Aerospace manufacturing
- **Aquitaine Corporation:** Sensor drones, personal electronics, computers
- **Arno:** Small Arms, toiletries, luxury foods
- **Bridgeport-Swift:** Vehicles and light aircraft
- **British Exospace:** Space drones, missiles and small starships
- **CaNICO:** Planetary and asteroid mining, heavy equipment, investments

- **Sortech Enterprises:** Robots, drones and walkers
- **Sumatro-Fabrique:** Heavy industry, personal and heavy weapons, vehicles
- **Tiranefabrik:** Heavy industry, especially large vehicles and hovercraft
- **Vannoccio:** Luxury vehicles

### AmeriCo

- **HEADQUARTERS:** New York, United States, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** Our mission is to be the premier consumer products company in Human Space, focused on convenience foods, beverages and personal grooming products. We seek to produce healthy financial rewards to investors as we provide opportunities for growth and enrichment to our employees, our business partners and the communities in which we operate.
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Carbonated beverages, snack foods, personal grooming products, smuggling
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English, Mandarin, French
- **CULTURE:** Profit is paramount
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 650,000
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Core, American Arm

AmeriCo began in America in the late 22nd Century as a door-to-door operation selling health and beauty products. Over the years, AmeriCo spread into other markets, such as beverage bottling, light manufacturing and other consumer goods. Eventually the corporation was established as an American tradition. As the colonisation of the stars began, AmeriCo began to target the colonial market and soon became a multi-world organisation.

As AmeriCo's original members died, they left their corporate holdings to their descendants. One of these saw the opportunity to use AmeriCo's numerous, far-flung factories as fronts for smuggling operations. Today, it is estimated that nearly 30 percent of all AmeriCo manufacturing locations serve periodically as ports of entry for illegal goods, although the company vehemently denies any involvement in wrong-doing. It has waged several legal battles over the past two decades in efforts to protect their corporate image.

### Far Ventures Bio-Tools

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Ouroboros Facility, French Continent, Beta Canum, French Arm
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** Sell humans our best/wonderful tools
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Pentapod bio-tools and products
- **LANGUAGE:** French, English, Pentapod Dialect C9
- **CULTURE:** Decidedly strange
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 2,000 humans and 8,000 Pentapods, all at Beta Canum
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** French Arm

This joint human-Pentapod corporation was set up in the late 2280s to market Pentapod biotechnology products to humans. Although Pentapod products are not allowed on Earth, Tirane is more flexible and serves as the primary market. They are likewise popular across the French Arm but due to quarantine by Earth, are seldom seen in either the American or Manchurian Arms.

## Terrorist Groups

Terrorist groups often start out dedicated to a cause they feel just but end up descending into an endless circle of violence as the original cause becomes lost in rhetoric and cycles of revenge.

### ProVolution

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Dispersed
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** The reigning social order must be removed in order for humanity to realise its true destiny. Natural evolution is done; humanity must finish the job.
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Cybernetics, prosthetics, nihilistic terrorism
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English, French, Mandarin, Russian
- **CULTURE:** Violent, secretive, will go to any lengths to accomplish a goal. Not overly subtle
- **STAFF LEVELS:** Unknown, likely 500 or so core members, plus many affiliates
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Core Worlds and terrorist actions along the Manchurian and French Arms

ProVolution, or Pro Evolution, is an outgrowth of transhumanist thought, although prominent transhumanists reject the link. While transhumanism, at its core, is about individual choice and agency, ProVolution is about force and evolution to suit the needs of society. The future according to ProVolution is a hive, everyone engineered and conditioned to fill the needs of society, both on Earth and among the stars. Although it does not form a core part of their tenets, the manifest destiny of humanity to conquer the stars is a long-term ideal.

ProVolution first appeared in the chaotic days following the French asteroid intercept mission. They saw the near-miss as a warning that humanity needed to expand into the universe. To do that, they felt, humanity would need to change, to grow tougher, smarter and faster. Natural evolution had done all it could and now humanity had to take control of its own destiny.

The movement would have been viewed as relatively benign had they not unleashed an engineered retrovirus on the island of Tristan de la Cunha, in the Atlantic Ocean. While ProVolution initially claimed responsibility, inviting the world's media to witness what the islanders would become, the terrible deaths of most of the islanders over the next 40 days removed any public sympathy the organisation may have had. The organisation folded and its leaders were tracked down by British and French forces, tried and imprisoned. They never explained the purpose of the disease, which later investigation revealed to be an aggressive retrovirus. There are persistent rumours that roughly 10% of the island's population survived, all under the age of 12. To this day, the island is under quarantine. It is unknown if anyone still lives there; orbital imagery reveals several large domes of unknown purpose but no people.

For the next 200 years, the name ProVolution faded into history, until late in the 23rd Century. An organisation calling itself ProVolution took credit for a terrorist bombing on Tirane. At first it was dismissed as a hoax but further attacks along the Manchurian Arm soon made it obvious that ProVolution was in existence once again. The group stated its goal as "the destruction of Earth's power over the colony worlds to prepare for the next steps in human-directed evolution".

ProVolution genetically and cybernetically enhances its agents but, because of limited resources and unconcern for the individual, worries little about possible side effects. ProVolution agents are often powerful but pay for it in shortened life expectancy, constant pain and/or mental instability. It is believed that missing persons end up as experiments on ProVolution laboratory tables each year. Some agents of ProVolution may not even be aware that they have been turned into living weapons, until their programming kicks in.

### Children of Mao

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Tibetan Plateau, Manchuria, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** China must be reunited and returned to the teachings of Mao Zedong
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Targeted terrorism, assassinations, drug smuggling
- **LANGUAGE(S):** Mandarin, Cantonese
- **CULTURE:** Secretive and subtle. Does a great deal of work behind the scenes
- **STAFF LEVELS:** Thought to be in the range of 5,000–8,000, with many sympathisers
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Core and terrorist actions along the Manchurian Arm

The Children of Mao preach an aesthetic of communism, and talk a great deal about "levelling society" and "equality for all". However, their main goal is to reunite the three Chinese nations into the historical nation of China. Once accomplished, the commissars of the New People's Revolution can bring everyone together through the teachings of the Red Book.

This organisation has operations on Earth and up and down the Manchurian Arm. They are responsible for at least 50% of the piracy and raiding that takes place in that region of space and are assumed to have a base in one of the many systems on the Arm that lack colonies or significant outposts.

Most of their operations are to obtain money and resources, and many disillusioned would-be revolutionaries have abandoned the organisation, saying profit is put before moral purity. These defectors are the primary source of information on the Children of Mao but they tend not to live long after their defection.

The Children of Mao are responsible for a number of political and cultural assassinations across the Manchurian Arm and into the Core. Their methods are always very similar: get close to the victim, then cut them to ribbons with a wire knife.

### Earth First

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Port Vila, Vanuatu, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** Earth must come first, the colonies are a pointless distraction
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Anti-colonial terrorism, piracy and info-hacking
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English, Chinese, French
- **CULTURE:** Loud, bragging, bigoted
- **STAFF LEVELS:** Thought to be in the range of 2,000–3,000, although Earth First claims millions of supporters
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Core, with terrorist actions within eight light years of Earth

Earth First believes the colonies, including Tirane, are a waste of resources. They point to the fact that Earth is hardly pristine and still bears the scars of Twilight. They further claim that money spent on extra-solar colonisation could have made Earth into a paradise. Members of this group generally oppose manned space flight of any kind.

Most Earth First targets are space-travel infrastructure, like spaceports, fuel facilities and companies involved in supporting and operating spacecraft. Most operations try to avoid loss of life but when it happens their press releases always blame their targets for putting people in harm's way.

Earth First is not a popular group and has very little sympathy or support. However, they operate openly on Vanautu Island, which seems to suffer few repercussions for supporting the terrorists. Why the people of Vanuatu support Earth First is another question and, given the closed nature of Vanuatu society, not one likely to be answered.

## Government and Military Organisations

As opposed to Foundations and Corporations, which are largely-independent of national concerns or even control, government organisations and militaries serve the interests of their governments. They include security agencies, national police services, exploration corps, coast guard and space guard units, along with actual military formations.

### British Pathfinders

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Chester, Britain, United Kingdom, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** To explore new worlds and open them for colonisation and commercial development
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Colony site planning, detailed exploration and surveys, colony construction
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English
- **CULTURE:** Open, professional, enthusiastic
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 7,000
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** French Arm

The Pathfinder Corps is a shadow of its former glory. The United Kingdom has not settled a new world since creating the colony on Joi and the Pathfinder Corps is little more than a glorified surveyor service. However, as the United Kingdom begins to look outward again, emboldened by the energy of the newly-independent Wellon, the Pathfinder Corps hopes to return to fulfilling their proper mission; exploring new worlds.

The Pathfinders are so renowned at their role that "pathfinder" has become a generic term for initial colonial survey and preparation teams.

### Deuxième Bureau de l'État-Major Général

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Constantine, Algeria, French Empire, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** The Bureau protects French interests and French citizens throughout human space, acting within the legal framework set by the Chamber of Deputies, authorised by the Emperor
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Intelligence-gathering, surveillance, covert security operations, law-enforcement
- **LANGUAGE(S):** French, Algerian, Arabic
- **CULTURE:** Paranoid, professional
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 31,000
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Human space, with emphasis on the French Arm and the Core

The Second Bureau of the General Staff was created shortly after the military coup that toppled the Fifth Republic in 2289. It amalgamated the former civilian security service with the military service that had served the generals so very well. This new agency took on the internal surveillance role that had been with La Gendarmerie National and combined it with the external surveillance and security duties of the military service.

The Second Bureau has sweeping law-enforcement powers throughout French territory but has failed to work effectively with colonial administrations. The size and power of the Second Bureau is of concern to the new Imperial Court and there are rumours that Ruffin will order it broken up. There are legitimate concerns for the loyalty of the Bureau's leaders, given that they were put in place by the old military junta that preceded Ruffin's government.

### External Security Directorate (ESD)

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Denver, Colorado, United States, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** Pre-empt threats and further US national security objectives by collecting intelligence, producing objective analysis, conducting effective covert action as directed by the President and safeguarding national secrets
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Intelligence-gathering, secure operations, surveillance
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English, Spanish
- **CULTURE:** Secretive, mistrustful, professional
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 65,000
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Human space, with emphasis on the Core

The External Security Directorate is charged with intelligence-gathering for the United States. It lacks law-enforcement powers, instead deferring to the National Security Office (NSO) on such matters. While the NSO's Office of Data Management oversees the American domestic surveillance program, the ESD maintains its own domestic surveillance, which, while not as extensive as the system run by the ODM, is more intrusive and subject to less oversight. Their external surveillance and spying is subject to no legal limit.

The ESD is not allowed to undertake covert action on American soil, including in the colonies. Other covert actions require Presidential approval, at least officially; unofficially, the ESD conducts operations under a blanket approval system. For example, ESD agents in Elysia did not need to seek permissions to conduct specific operations, like the rendition of rebel leader Emilio Girouard into French custody, as they already had carte blanche to conduct operations in support of "allied interests" on Joi.

### Le Contrôle de Quarantaine Orbitale

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Gateway Station, Earth Géosynchronous Orbit, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** The Orbital Quarantine command is tasked with ensuring the biological integrity of Earth's ecosystem. To this end, the OQC has the mandate to search any, and all, vessels entering terrestrial space
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Quarantine and inspection, limited force projection
- **LANGUAGE(S):** Russian, French, English
- **CULTURE:** Paranoid, aggressive, professional
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 14,000
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Earth Orbit and Cis-Lunar Space

Le Contrôle de Quarantaine Orbitale (Orbital Quarantine Command) arose in the wake of the disastrous fungal blight that befell Russia early in the new space age. A Russian exploration ship did not properly contain biological samples and when they were examined at the lab in northern Russian, an alien fungal infection was able to escape. It took Russia nearly 50 years to contain the infection and even today it still springs up in isolated pockets across the north of the country.

Russia's space program never recovered and almost all Russian ship-building since has been patrol craft as part of the French-orchestrated Contrôle de Quarantaine Orbitale. Russia is driven to ensure Russia, and by extension Earth, will never be at risk from contagion again.

### La Légion Étrangère

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Algiers, Algeria, French Empire, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** The mission is sacred, we carry it out until the end and, if necessary in the field, at the risk of our lives
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Force projection, assault and garrison forces
- **LANGUAGE(S):** French, Arabic
- **CULTURE:** Aggressive, professional, loyal to the Legion
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 21,000
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Core, French Arm

The French Foreign Legion is the most famous military organisation in space. Their training is excellent, although not up to par with special forces or other elite units. Their esprit de corps, however, is unmatched. Legionnaires do not leave their comrades behind and will continue to fight long after other units would have abandoned the battlefield. After one term of service, Legionnaires are eligible for French citizenship.

**Joining the Foreign Legion:**  
Travellers choosing the Army career can opt to join the Foreign Legion, gaining DM+1 for enlistment if they do so. However, they will suffer DM-1 to all survival rolls. All legionnaires automatically receive Language (French) 0 as part of their basic training. Foreign Legion characters never have to check for morale.

### Royal Aerospace Force

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Boscombe Down, United Kingdom, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** Providing security and force projection for the United Kingdom on Earth and across human space
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Aerospace defence, intelligence, transportation, interface operation
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English, French
- **CULTURE:** Elitist, professional
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 16,500
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Earth, British Colony worlds

The Royal Aerospace Force, formerly the Royal Air Force, is one of the oldest aerospace forces in the human sphere, dating back to the years of the First World War. Still considered junior to the prestigious Royal Navy, and not as spectacular as the Royal Space Navy, the RAF is a remarkably professional force, with a very high esprit de corps; enough that they often come across as elitist and arrogant.

The RAF provides ground support and air superiority to British forces. The Aerospace Defence arm is in a constant jurisdictional war with the RSN, as the new Wellington-class aerospace fighters are stutterwarp-capable. The RAF claims this was to allow craft to engage targets far from sensitive orbital infrastructure and well before any attacking craft would be in range to attack surface locations.

### Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** The RCMP is Canada's national police service. Proud of its traditions and confident in meeting future challenges, it is committed to preserving the peace, upholding the law and providing quality service in partnership with communities and confederation members
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Policing, surveillance, counter-intelligence
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English, French
- **CULTURE:** Professional, guarded
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 29,000
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Canada, Canadian outposts and colonies, Stark, Chengdu

The RCMP was re-named back to their old designation as part of the Canadian quadricentennial celebrations in 2268. Before that, and for nearly 150 years, they were known as the Confederation National Police (CNP), a nod to the looser Canadian confederation that emerged in the wake of Twilight. The renamed service reflected increased cooperation with the United Kingdom and restoration of the former Commonwealth. There is a growing movement to rename the police service back to the CNP, however, especially in Quebec and the Prairie provinces, where monarchist sympathies are minimal.

The RCMP is an effective national police service, responsible for the operation of the national surveillance program through the Communications Security Establishment (CSE). The RCMP also provides security for Canadian off-world outposts and colonies, and has liaison offices in Canadian enclaves to work with local law enforcement. The force is tasked with providing security for the Canadian Enclave on Stark, the Sung home world, although military reinforcements are never far away.

### Tanstaafl Free Legion

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Tanstaafl City, Tanstaafl, Aurore, Eta Bootes, French Arm
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** An independent private military corporation dedicated to the defence of the Tanstaafl colony and its people. The Legion serves to protect the colony from all threats, foreign and domestic, in particular the alien threat of the Kaefers
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Colonial defence, Light mechanised Infantry
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English
- **CULTURE:** Aggressive, professional
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 4,000
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Tanstaafl Colony, Aurore, French Arm

Tanstaafl's free-market economy has solved the ex-colony's principal defence problem; without a regular standing army they have elected to hire mercenaries to serve as their main defensive force. The Tanstaafl Free Legion (TFL) consists of professional soldiers and adventurers from throughout human space, attracted to Aurore by high pay, booty and a chance to fight Kaefers. In fact, TFL pay is not exceptional, and the opportunities for booty from a foe as alien as the Kaefers are limited, but the chances to fight Kaefers are certainly plentiful.

The Legion is under contract to the Tanstaafl government, defending the colony's territory, citizens, and property. The Legion is also charged with putting into practice policy decisions and orders issued by the government. It is this role that causes considerable friction between the government and the mercenary unit's command staff.

### Texas Rangers

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Austin, Texas, Earth, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** Pre-empt threats and further US national security objectives by collecting intelligence, producing objective analysis, conducting effective covert action as directed by the President, while safeguarding national secrets
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Law enforcement, criminal investigations, surveillance
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English, Spanish
- **CULTURE:** Open, forthright, somewhat arrogant
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 12,500
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Texas and Texan colonies and outposts

The Texas Rangers have an almost-mythical quality, in Texas and the colonies, and have a solid reputation with Mexico. The Rangers are in charge of border patrol and internal surveillance, along with serving as the central police force for the nation. They work closely with various urban police departments and have an effective relationship with the American NSO.

Much like the RCMP, the Rangers are a paramilitary organisation and can serve as the core of militia units when required.

### United States Space Force (USSF)

- **HEADQUARTERS:** Goddard Station, L4, Cis-Lunar Space, Sol, Core
- **MISSION STATEMENT:** The United States Space serves as force projection and defence for American citizens and American interests
- **PRODUCTS/SERVICES:** Offensive and defensive starship operations and planetary operations support
- **LANGUAGE(S):** English
- **CULTURE:** Aggressive, professional
- **STAFF LEVELS:** 31,000
- **SCOPE OF OPERATIONS:** Core Systems, American Arm, French Arm

The United States Space Force (USSF), sometimes called the American Space Force, is a small but very professional and advanced organisation. Prior to the recent build-up, most USSF vessels were either American modifications and upgrades of French vessels or else home-built long range vessels that acted more as slow tenders for attack craft rather than true heavy combatants. The Central Asian War changed that way of thinking. The few battles fought during the war indicated a need to change tactics. While France shifted to heavy, multipurpose vessels, the United States concentrated on mobility and firepower, in the form of fast missiles and armed drones.

By 2300, most USSF vessels emphasise mobility and firepower over armour, with an emphasis on fast missiles and armed drones. This doctrine has proven effective in the limited engagements since the Central Asian War.

### Military Rank Structures

## Aliens And Animals

By 2300, Humanity has encountered five other sentient species, from the hostile and murderous Kaefers to the bizarre and unfathomable Pentapods. Of these species, two possessed starfaring capability at time of contact: the Pentapods and the Kaefers. A third species, the Ebers, lost that technology, along with everything else, when they bombed themselves back to a Stone Age 4,000 years ago.

The aliens and animals featured in this chapter have a number of Traits, which are explained on page 100. All intelligent aliens also feature an Alienation entry, which affects their SOC characteristic and is used as an indicator of a unique element of their culture or biology that influences how they deal with humans.

### The Ebers

Although the Eber were not the first intelligent aliens encountered, they did provide the first hard proof of extra-terrestrial intelligence. Their ruins on several worlds of the Chinese Arm identified them as an interstellar civilisation and ruins explained what had become of them.

**First Encounter**  
In 2249, alien ruins were uncovered on Daikoku and then similar ones on Heidelsheimat three years later. These discoveries set the stage for the discovery of the Ebers and their homeworld at 82 Eridani in 2256, the third alien species contacted by humanity. There are three abandoned colony worlds where Eber ruins can be found but so far there are few technological artefacts.

Initial relations with the Ebers were awkward, due to the importance of ceremony and protocol to the aliens. Once Humans understood this fact, relations became much warmer as Humans learned to adapt (and not the reverse). Humans who deal with Ebers must do so in Eber dress, using Eber customs, at an Eber's pace.

The Ebers were never able to rise above the factionalism that marked so much of their history and they brought that to the stars, which proved their undoing. The Final War lasted over a generation and reduced the left-overs of their civilisation to the stone age.

- 2249: Discovery of Eber Ruins on Daikoku
- 2250: First Contact with the Xiang

**Technology**  
The civilised Ebers of the coastal cities on Kormoran single continent recently built their first train, although they have possessed steam power for about a generation now. Primitive firearms are also available to these coastal peoples. While they still have stories and legends of their time as a starfaring culture, virtually none of that technology remains. The nomadic inhabitants of the desert at the centre of the continent are still comparatively primitive and aside from some basic metal-smelting for gold and copper, they remain barely above the stone age.

**Kormoran**
- **Primary Name:** 82 Eridani
- **X, Y, Z Coordinates:** 9.5, 11.2, -13.9
- **Distance from Earth:** 20.22 light years
- **UPP:** EA87874-3 N 564

Kormoran is a dry, hot world, with extensive deserts and deep blue seas. The surface gravity of 1.46 Gs is uncomfortable and requires some mitigation for most people. There is no PEAM Modification available for this world. Most of the civilised Ebers make their homes in the ancient ruins along the sea coasts, while nomads have taken to the extensive desert wastes.

**Physical Description**  
Ebers are heavy, bipedal creatures about two metres tall, with thick, short legs, extremely long, thin arms and no discernible heads. The body and legs are covered with dense, shaggy fur, normally rust-brown in colour. Their short legs and heavy body give them a pronounced waddling walk. On top of the shoulders, where a head would be on a human, Ebers have a pair of flexible eye-stalks, two long, horse-like ears and a short, trunk-like proboscis.

**Characteristics**  
Most Ebers encountered are from the towns and cities built on the ruins of their old civilisation, although the wilderness areas of their home world are prowled by more primitive nomads.

- **Traits:** Heightened Senses, Large, Slow Metabolism (-1), STR (+2), Tough (+2)
- **Alienation:** Ebers appear to undergo marked changes in personality when they change in their role in society. Some memories can change or disappear when this occurs and there are often marked shifts in personality.

**EBER TOWNSPERSON**  
*Dances-in-Moonlight has made a great deal of money acting as a broker between his people and the Arabs in the Old-town enclave. He is not overly curious about the humans but does have his eye on a nomad girl who keeps coming to town.*

### The Pentapods

The pentapods, more than any other species encountered, are defined by their technology. They are their technology, with genetically-manipulated lifeforms forming the vast bulk of their tools and equipment. Much of this technology is clearly based on the pentapods themselves, which many find disquieting. Despite their alien nature, they are becoming fast friends with humans. This might be due to them being the only culture aside from the Kaefers that can meet humans on relatively equal terms.

**First Encounter**  
In 2251, the ARI sent a pair of survey vessels to DM+27 28217, a red dwarf just out from DM+36 2219 on the French Arm. Upon approaching the second of the system's three planets, the vessels encountered a globular, organic-looking object, several hundred metres in diameter. The ARI survey team included a xenobiologist and after a careful sensor scan, the xenobiologist and an assistant were sent in a small ship's boat to view the object up close. Upon approaching the object, the xenobiologist theorised that it was a vessel and when an opening appeared in its side, flew the boat in.

The object did indeed prove to be a vessel, the starship of a previously unknown species, the Pentapods. Peaceful contact was established and by 2261, the Pentapods had gone so far as to establish an enclave on Beta Canum Venaticorum, an important colony world on the French Arm.

**Physical Description**  
The most commonly-encountered Pentapods are five-limbed amphibians standing about one metre tall. Their head is a bullet-shaped bony case housing the brain and the main sensory organs. Five eyes on stalks provide full circle vision and can be retracted into depressions in the skull. Five additional sensitive strips between the eyes respond to temperature and infrared light. The very tip of the head is pierced by a breathing hole leading through the skull to the body below it and the gill-lungs. Attached to the skull are five legs, each of which is internally supported by three rigid bones and terminates in a fleshy pad. Just above this foot are four short, fleshy tentacles that serve as dexterous manipulators. Between each of the five legs is a web of leathery skin. The body is a muscular sac that hangs below the skull and contains all of the internal organs. Pentapods will often "sit" on their body to use all five limbs for some task.

**Technology**  
Humans realise that Pentapods view themselves as machines, each individual filling its niche in the overall Pentapod society. To humans then, Pentapods seem to be members of a species that, in the pursuit of biotechnology, sadly lost its identity as a collection of individuals.

**HOMEWORLD: GOD|HOME**
- **Primary Name:** DM+43 1953 I
- **X, Y, Z Coordinates:** -28.4, 19.8, 32.1
- **Distance from Earth:** 29.02 light years
- **UPP:** A64A978C N Wa, 368

The Pentapods hail from the first of two worlds in orbit around DM+43 1953, a small orange star. Only one human mission, a French diplomatic party in 2285, has ever visited. They declined to stay, despite the friendliness of their hosts. Many of them required subsequent treatment for psychological problems and approximately 12% ended up as hosts for invasive Pentapod tech.

**Characteristics**  
Individuals within Pentapod society are wildly-variable, based on their designed purpose. The following characteristics and Traits apply to the human relations Pentapods commonly encountered, as well as to others similar in form and function.

- **Traits:** Aquatic (12 hours), Fast Metabolism (+1), INT (+1), Small (-1), STR (-2)
- **Alienation:** Pentapods are so tightly-integrated with their technology that it can be difficult to know whether their biotech is a mere tool or something more. Their SOC characteristic indicates how close to baseline they are, with higher being more modified.

**HUMAN RELATIONS PENTAPOD**  
*Human relations Pentapods are engineered to have a more pleasing and soothing appearance and personality to humans. They are what most people think of as a "typical" Pentapod.*

### The Sung

The Sung were the first sapient alien species to be discovered by humans and in many ways bear the most similarities to humans in culture and thought processes.

**First Encounter**  
The Sung were first encountered in 2247 in their home system by a Manchurian exploration team. First contact occurred when the Manchurian expedition, investigating mysterious signals from the system's third planet, detected a Sung interplanetary craft. Assuming the source of the signals, as well as the ship, was some unexpected human expedition, the Manchurians attempted communication. The signals that returned were obviously non-human and the Manchurians panicked and fled from the system. They returned directly to Earth, with the news that there were technologically advanced aliens at the fringes of the Manchurian Arm.

Another expedition was quickly sent back out. This joint Manchurian-Canadian expedition consisted of a pair of warships in case the aliens proved hostile, along with a sophisticated survey vessel. These ships also carried teams of exobiological, linguistic and diplomatic experts. Remaining in the outer regions of the system to avoid being seen as a threat, the expedition was successful in initiating peaceful communications with the Sung.

**Physical Description**  
The Sung are the only sapient species yet discovered that is capable of natural flight. When standing straight, the typical Sung has a height of approximately 120 centimetres but as Sung posture is slightly stooped, they appear to be even shorter. Sung wings, located midway between a pair of forelimbs and a pair of back limbs, have a span of about five metres and taper down to the tips. Sung forelimbs are small and delicate, while back limbs are strongly muscled and sturdy. Their flat tail and crested head are all adaptations for flight. Sung bodies are hairless with soft and supple skin.

**The Slaver War**  
Progress continued until a Canadian group discovered that the Xiang, previously-assumed to be animals, were in fact another sapient species. When news of their apparent slavery reached Earth, an outcry was raised that led to the Slaver War.

Sung interplanetary vessels were no match for human stutterwarp warships. With very little loss of Sung lives, human dominance was accepted under the system of Sos-Soon-Atkacharr. Under this philosophy, more "advanced" societies have an obligation to raise up less-advanced cultures to their level. At the same time, the less-advanced cultures have an obligation to repay the other, in the form of labour, resources or other tangible material.

Since the end of the Slaver War, relations between Sung and humans have steadily improved into a system of free cooperation. The only significant points of friction are human control of the Xiang homeworld and the continued refusal to teach the Sung how to construct stutterwarp drives.

**Technology**  
The Sung are roughly comparable to humans. In some areas, such as medicine, they are more advanced; in others, such as star travel and power generation technology, they are at a lower level. At first contact, Sung had developed interplanetary ships equipped with both magnetic sails and high-efficiency ion drives.

**HOMEWORLD: VASSHON (STARK)**
- **Primary Name:** DM+4 123
- **X, Y, Z Coordinates:** 22.0, 4.4, 1.9
- **Distance from Earth:** 22.52 light years
- **UPP:** B767977-C N 634

The Sung hail from Stark, the third world in orbit around DM+4 123. It is a world slightly smaller than Earth and with a somewhat lighter gravity, although still in the range of Normal. Aside from some unusual pollen-like contaminants, the world is remarkably pleasant.

**Characteristics**  
The skin of most Sung is often a patchwork of markings, some only visible in the ultraviolet range. They have four sets of eyes, two large and two small. The smaller eyes have visual acuity into the near ultraviolet, allowing them to see colours humans cannot. However, their senses of smell and taste are atrophied in comparison to humans.

- **Traits:** Flyer (Slow), UV Vision, Small (-1)
- **Alienation:** SOC for a Sung indicates the status of their nation under Sos-Soon-Atkacharr. It is equivalent in many ways to the human use of SOC but more nuanced. Within a nation, the SOC value varies from 1D over or under the listed SOC and indicates their place within that nation. Between nations, however, they always use the national SOC. Even a beggar from a high SOC nation outranks an executive from a low SOC nation. Humans have SOC 13 under the dictates of Sos-Soon-Atkacharr.

**SUNG TRADER**  
*Cassels is a typical Sung trader, serving on the ion drive ships that form the backbone of the various Sung national fleets. He chaffs at being forced to use "old" technology while humans cruise around his system in stutterwarp ships.*

- **STR:** 6
- **DEX:** 9
- **END:** 12
- **INT:** 9
- **EDU:** 9
- **SOC:** 10
- **Skills:** Admin 1, Astrogation 1, Athletics (dexterity) 4, Broker 1, Steward 1
- **Equipment:** Comm, Clothing, Computer
- **Weapons:** Laser pistol similar to P3
- **Armour:** None

### The Xiang

Of the known sapient species, the Xiang are the most technologically backward, without even the rudimentary tool use of the Arbors. However, their sophisticated art reveals their true intelligence and they have an almost intuitive grasp of complex mathematics.

**First Encounter**  
There were a few Xiang in evidence on the Sung homeworld when humans first arrived but the Sung did not mention their intelligence and the newly-arrived humans saw no sign of the Xiang's brilliant minds. When a human research team finally reached the Xiang homeworld, however, Xiang art convinced them that the species possessed at least nominal intelligence. A few experimental contacts soon proved the Xiang were as intelligent as humans but with no desire for advanced technology. The Xiang have a symbiotic relationship with another organism that they call a "Dirt Mother". This connection has led the Xiang to have consuming concern for the balance of nature.

The fact that the Sung had great strip mines on this beautiful moon, where they worked the nature-loving Xiang, soon led to an outcry of "slavery" among humans. The Sung justified themselves by the system of Sos-Soon-Atkacharr, saying it was only natural that the technologically primitive should serve the advanced. In return, they offered the Xiang the benefits of knowledge and technology. They did not see it as their fault that the Xiang did not desire those benefits. Humans disagreed with this view and the Slaver War was born, ending in the breaking of Sung power over the Xiang and the establishment of human power over the Sung.

**Physical Description**  
The Xiang are similar in structure to Terran arthropods, particularly the crustaceans. Some likened them to fleas or spiders in appearance, although much larger. The Xiang body is covered by a tough carapace and consists of a horizontal main portion that contains the internal organs and is supported by eight of their ten segmented legs. The other two legs can also act as manipulatory arms and are most often used that way. At the rear, a small, segmented tail curls under; at the front, a head holds the mouth and primary sensory apparatus. The average Xiang stands about one metre tall and is one metre in length.

The Xiang head is dominated by two large, bulging eyes, one to either side of the head. Between them runs a line of four vestigial eyespots, surmounted by another, slightly larger pair. Just below the row of eyespots is the creature's mouth, externally a strong beak for cutting, surrounded by four tiny arms, each with a pair of digits for holding food.

**Technology**  
The Xiang display little interest in advanced technology, although items like looms do attract their interest. Despite this, they have a keen, almost intuitive grasp of higher mathematics. They also surround themselves with a wide variety of plants that show signs of definite manipulation, although likely of typical cross-breeding and hybridisation.

**HOMEWORLD: HOME OF THE MOTHER**
- **Primary Name:** DM+4 123 (moon of fifth planet)
- **X, Y, Z Coordinates:** 22.0, 4.4, 1.9
- **Distance from Earth:** 22.52 light years
- **UPP:** E667710-1 2 0 Po

The Xiang homeworld is a large moon orbiting DM+4 123's fifth planet, which is a gas giant. Cool and dark, this moon nonetheless supports an abundance of life. The Xiang are apex predators and one of the largest animals on the moon as well, with little to fear from any native life. Home of the Mother is a Low Gravity world.

**Characteristics**  
As the apex predators on their homeworld, the Xiang are formidable hunter/trappers. Their bite is venomous but appears to cause little more than a mild allergic reaction in both humans and Sung. To their much smaller prey animals, however, it is a powerful paralytic. They are neither fast, nor willing to chase, preferring to lie in wait for prey.

- **Traits:** Armour (+2), END -2, Heightened Senses, INT (+2), IR Vision, Slow Metabolism (-2), Natural Weapons (bite D3)
- **Alienation:** For Xiang, SOC is a measure of how closely tied they are to their Dirt Mother. This governs their interactions with others, as well as determining the distance, in kilometres, they can bear to be separated. Younger Xiang, more closely bound to the Dirt Mother, have a lower SOC. SOC 10+ means the Dirt Mother is dead and the Xiang can wander freely.

**XIANG ARTIST**  
*Kikitik-tihaklal is a weaver, currently in the early female stage of her life-cycle. She cannot bear to be more than five kilometres away from her dirt mother. In addition to her weaving, she spends a great deal of time working with humans, trying to figure them out.*

- **STR:** 9
- **DEX:** 13
- **END:** 8
- **INT:** 8
- **EDU:** 2
- **SOC:** 5
- **Skills:** Art (visual media) 2, Melee (bite) 0, Recon 1, Stealth 3, Survival 2
- **Equipment:** Weaving sticks, dyed arthro silk

### The Kaefers

Implacable, violent and frightening, the Kaefers are a great mystery to the humans of 2300AD. Their name is a corruption of a German slang word, meaning "bug". To the French, they are "les cafards", to the Texans of Tanstaafl, "roaches" and the Ukrainians call them "Rukh" (crayfish or lobster).

**First Contact**  
Humanity's first contact with the Kaefers came in 2295, when several alien vessels entered the Arcturus system from outside human space. The French research station orbiting the star attempted to make contact, broadcasting greetings in several languages. The alien vessels did attempt to respond but the language gap was too wide. After a couple of days near the only discharge point in the system, the alien vessels withdrew back into unknown space.

Three years later, the aliens returned. This time, they attacked without warning and captured the station, then swept on to attack the nearby colony world of Aurore. Human forces eventually drove the aliens off but not before they landed several thousand troops on the beleaguered colony world. The past two years have been spent in vicious ground actions to eliminate the invaders, who committed atrocities on the human populations after the initial landings, resulting in near 50% casualties in all three colonies.

From all accounts, the Kaefers live to fight. Even in their camps, there appears to be little discipline, with fights breaking out constantly.

**Technology**  
Kaefer technology is almost uniformly sturdier and bulkier than human equivalents. It is nonetheless effective. On the average, the level of technology is very similar to humans, with a couple of exceptions. First, computers and electronics are notably heavier, slower and less efficient than human designs, with follow-on effects that limit the effectiveness of some computer-controlled technology. Stutterwarp drives are a notable example, with the drives themselves being as effective as human models, but the controlling computers and software are unable to maintain cycling rates as high as humans. The second difference is in weapons, especially laser and plasma weapons. Kaefer designs are simply more mature, despite the lag in electronics.

**Physical Description**  
The Kaefers are a roughly humanoid creature approximately two metres tall. They have a vaguely insectoid appearance, enhanced by the large carapace on their backs, the bristly, hairlike projections on their forearms and lower legs, and their vertical lobster-like mouths, which consist of a complicated arrangement of mouthparts between two large, powerful mandibles. They are implacable in combat, neither offering nor accepting surrender. Their behaviour in combat is unpredictable however, as sometimes they are ineffective and other times they are cunning and deadly. Their officers have been observed to beat their soldiers, forcing them into battle. At this point in time, very little is known about these creatures.

Kaefers have been observed in two very different behavioural states in combat. When fighting is first joined, they will appear very disorganised and act in a chaotic and seemingly-stupid fashion. This is their so-called "Low State". However, after a bit of time, they will suddenly "wake up" and become much more capable opponents. This is their "High State". The reason for change is unknown as this time.

**HOMEWORLD**  
The location of the Kaefer homeworld is currently unknown but is thought be in or near the Serpentis systems. Long range imaging of these systems hints at considerable activity, including the presence of massive space habitats, large enough to be within the resolving power of the long baseline arrays.

**Characteristics**  
Implacably hostile, the Kaefers are divided into a very small "officer" caste and the much larger "trooper" caste. Troopers are practically expendable, initially attacking in waves. After time, although, they appear to "smarten up" and become tactical near-geniuses.

- **Low State and High State:** Entering High State is a characteristic check: Formidable (-6), SOC, Instant. Check once per combat round after combat begins. DM+1 if there is a Leader present to "encourage" the Troopers and DM+1 for each round of combat after the second.
- **Low State Traits:** Armour (+2), INT (-6), Slow Metabolism (-1), STR (+1)
- **High State Traits:** Armour (+2), Fast Metabolism (+1), STR (+1)
- **Alienation:** For Kaefers, SOC represents how easily they can enter High State when triggered. Leaders, with a high SOC, can enter High State more quickly and their Low-State is not as low as a Trooper.

**KAEFER TROOPER**  
*Chak-ah is a typical trooper, interested in little but fighting and eating. Now past fertile child-bearing years, Chak'ah is a slave to violence.*

- **STR:** 9
- **DEX:** 7
- **END:** 8
- **INT:** 2/8 (Low/High State)
- **EDU:** 2
- **SOC:** 5
- **Skills:** Gun Combat (slug) 2, Recon 1, Stealth 1, Survival 2
- **Equipment:** None
- **Weapons:** Thud Gun assault rifle
- **Armour:** None

**Kaefer Weapons**

| Weapon | Type | Length | Mass | Ammunition | Muzzle Velocity | Magazine | Magazine Mass | RoF | Traits |
|--------|------|--------|------|------------|-----------------|----------|---------------|-----|--------|
| **Horse Pistol** | 12.5mm revolver | 31cm | 1.3kg | 14.1×31mm fixed cartridge ball | 490 mps | 7-round cylinder | 0.3kg | — | — |
| **Thud Gun** | 27.2mm grenade launcher | 76.2cm | 6.5kg (empty) | 12.1×31mm APHE | 610 mps | 66-round magazine | 2kg | 900 rpm | Auto 3, AP4 |

*The so-called horse pistol is an extremely rugged and heavy revolver. It is oddly shaped, to human eyes, with a half-ring support, which fits around the Kaefer's wrist when it grasps the weapon's frame behind the cylinder, rather than a pistol grip as in human weapons.*

*The Thud Gun is an assault rifle/grenade launcher combination that is similar in some respects to the old American M-2 but with a grenade launcher. It has the general appearance of a rifle, with recognizable stock, trigger and magazine assemblies, however the overall shape is oddly curved. The grenade launcher is effectively identical to human 30mm designs.*

### The Arbors

Appearing for all the world like sentient trees, the biology of the Arbors is a mix of animal and vegetative qualities, a product of the harsh realities of their homeworld.

**First Contact**  
In late 2299, a Trilon ISV-21 class exploratory vessel, the LaFarge, was damaged by a Kaefer intruder, forcing the remains of the crew to abandon the ship in orbit over the second planet of the distant star DM+17 2611, which is past Eta Bootis at the edge of the Wolf Cluster. The SLV-50 lander was itself damaged in the escape and subsequent hard landing and the crew was forced to abandon it as well; it is entirely possible that they might have perished had they not made contact with the Arbors.

After an arduous overland journey, the crew came across the Arbor city, a vast, yet primitive, construction on the shores of the world's sole ocean. This city was home to thousands of the alien creatures, who were just waking from a long winter hibernations when the desperate crew arrived.

**Physical Description**  
Arbors are plant-like, although they exhibit some characteristics of animals. The shuffle about on three to five root-like legs, and during the cold season actually extend the roots into the ground to anchor and sustain them while hibernating. From the legs sprouts a thick, trunk-like body, with the lower portion containing a mouth. They typically have anywhere from three to five leaf-covered upper limbs, branch/arms, although they can have as few as one or as many as seven. Where the arms meet the trunk is a collection of eye-spots, a sort of primitive, low-resolution compound eye. In most Arbors, it is only useful for detecting movement and sensing light and dark, with very little resolving power.

In some, however, naturally occurring minerals in the soil are collected by the root systems and precipitate out around the eye-cleft, forming imperfect lenses that offer some focusing ability and greater resolving power. Those few Arbors who can actually see, however poorly, are the highest class.

**Technology**  
Even stone tools are beyond Arbors, nor have they discovered fire. Most of their tools are shaped pieces of wood and something very like bone, used for digging and wall building in their city. Arbors make a variety of ropes and woven material, and have recently discovered how to make rafts for transportation. Beyond these examples, however, they have practically no tool use. The travois the human crew used to move an injured crew member to the city sparked something of a revolution in the Arbors, who have since started making use of it.

**HOMEWORLD: LIGHTFALL**
- **Primary Name:** DM+17 2611
- **X, Y, Z Coordinates:** -24.0, -11.5, 11.1
- **Distance from Earth:** 28.84 light years
- **UPP:** X763311-0 Ic

The Arbor symbol for their world is something along the lines of "quiet place where the light of the sun falls" but shortened by the first contact team to Lightfall. It is a cold world in the DM+17 2611 system, part of the Wolf Cluster, out past Eta Bootis.

**Characteristics**  
Large, slow and bulky, Arbors can grow to nearly three metres tall. Most of them are effectively blind, although they can sense movement through the ground.

- **Traits:** DEX (-1), EDU (-4), END (+2), INT (-1), Large (+1 to +3), Slow Metabolism (-2), Unusual Sense (Tremorsense, 50m)
- **Alienation:** Most Arbors are effectively blind and cannot make sight-based Recon or Investigate checks. Those who can are the elite of their society. Most Arbors have a SOC of 1–6, with 5 or 6 being "high class" individuals. Their SOC modifier is used as a DM for all Recon or Investigate checks that rely on sight.


## Animals of the Frontier

Life is common across human space, with many worlds host to diverse, and often hostile, ecosystems. The animals here represent a narrow selection from many worlds and serve as examples of creatures a Traveller could encounter in the wilds of a Frontier world.

### Burrowvarg

This small, dog-like animal originally hails from Beta Canum. The main issue with owning these animals is their different (right-handed amino acid) biochemistry, which means they require special food. They are generally not seen on worlds that cannot natively support them.

### Cave Dragon

The cave dragon is the largest of the so-called 'draco-forms' found on Beowulf. It hunts in the cooler 'morning' and 'evening' phases of Beowulf's very long day and takes to caves and underground burrows for the hot 'mid-day' and the long, cold night, where it enters a sort of hibernation for the coldest period.

The typical cave dragon is roughly the size of a terrestrial heavy horse, fast and well-protected around its face and mouth. Like many draco-forms, it can spit stomach acid to blind and incapacitate prey. Between its armour and over-all toughness, most smaller-calibre hunting weapons are of little use against this creature. It was specifically this animal that the Rockwell 12-81 Magnum rifle was developed to deal with.

| **Traits** | Armour (+10), Large (+3) | |

### Dragonbat

The Dragonbat is a large and deservedly feared predator of the mountainous regions of Beowulf. This fearless flyer is capable of taking off with prey of up to 20 kilograms in its sharp claws and can kill or injure animals several times larger. At very close range, it can spit digestive acid, aiming for the eyes.

One of the more feared 'demons' on Cold Mountain, the Flying Blind is a flat, airborne creature, which resemble a Chinese kite or the slats from a Venetian blind; each 'blind' edge is razor sharp and they attack by swooping into prey edge-on. The 'blinds' are held together by a tether of edge material, which snaps when the creature reproduces by splitting.

The following statistics are for an average-size creature. Smaller and much larger specimens have been noted.

### Gatinnhos de Seva

A cunning and capable hunter, native to the Brazilian world of Paulo, the gatinnhos runs in packs, taking shifts as they chase down their prey, eventually falling upon the exhausted animal. They are also known to use some devious tactics, including ambush and surprise.

### Hellshark

This creature is the greatest fear of the scouting teams on the panthalassic world of Haifeng. A full-grown hellshark is in excess of 100 metres long, with a gaping maw studded with two-metre-long teeth. The maw has two clusters of tentacles, one on either side, 8–12 tentacles per cluster depending on species, which grab prey and shove them into the maw to be torn apart by the teeth. Although there are larger creatures on Haifeng, none are as aggressive as the hellshark.

### Night Stalker

The various sub-species of night-stalker are found across all three continents of Beta Canum as a climax predator. Low-slung, slender, but powerfully-built, the stalker has a long tri-partite mouth full of sharp, ripping teeth. Its night-vision and olfactory senses are very keen but its sense of hearing is a little dull, around human normal limits. It has a long, thin prehensile tail and like an opossum it hangs from its tail high up in trees to sleep.

Normal prey for the Night Stalker are the many small animals that roam the forests but it will not hesitate to attack a human. In the winter months, female night-stalkers will look for larger prey to serves as hosts for its young. While it is carrying eggs, the night-stalker's ovipositor secretes venom from a pair of barbs. Against Beta Canum animals, it will paralyse most bodily functions and the night-stalker then inject up to 12 eggs into the unfortunate host. The creature will truss the unwilling host in a nest-like arrangement of grass and twigs to wait for the eggs to hatch, which takes about 12–18 hours. When humans are stung, the venom triggers a massive allergic reaction in 90% of people and while not always fatal, it is always agonising. Fortunately, human body chemistries usually kill the implanted eggs before they hatch but if left in they can trigger infections and poisoning from sepsis.

### Titan

A vicious plains-hunter native to Adlerhorst. This flightless bird-analogue can reach speeds of up to 80 kilometres per hour in the open. It prefers to strike from concealment and quickly runs its prey down. Heavy rifles or handguns are required to defend against this creature. Some of the slightly-smaller species hunt in packs.

### White Wing

This large, winged predator from Hermes is feared and respected by the inhabitants of Hermes, its native world. Large and powerful, it is often the subject of hunts, both photographic and trophy. Sometimes the hunters do not return. The white wing will hunt day or night and can use its sonar to broadcast a tremendous, terrifying scream.

### Zururyu ('Clever Dragon')

This lizard-like animal, native to Joi, is one of several non-terrestrial proto-intelligences. As such, it is protected by the Kigali Accords, much to the disgust of many colonial farmers who have lost entire crops to this clever creature.

It is judged to be smarter than a terrestrial gorilla and some experts state that they have developed a language. Any Japanese colonist of Joi would attest to their intelligence, especially after a well-protected and fenced garden had been raided by a troop of these creatures. Oddly enough, they tend to leave the carefully tended Zen gardens alone. The Japanese often also refer to them as Chibigoji ('little Godzilla'), especially after one of their garden raids.

## TRAITS

Traits are typically found only in non-human aliens and animals. However, some traits can be acquired through the DNA Modification process, giving alien or animal traits to humans.

**Aquatic/X:** The alien, uplift, or DNAM recipient is adapted to life underwater. It can breathe underwater, or hold its breath for a long period. The species cannot operate out of water without life support and some sort of mechanical aid.

Aquatic creatures can remain underwater for the time period listed in the Aquatic trait. Aquatic creatures gain DM+4 to Athletics (endurance) checks for swimming and can swim at a speed in metres equal to their END.

| Trait | Underwater Endurance |
|-------|----------------------|
| Aquatic/1 | END × 10 minutes |
| Aquatic/2 | END × 2 hours |
| Aquatic/3 | Unlimited |

**Atmospheric Requirements (X):** The species requires an unusual combination of gases to breathe and cannot survive in most atmospheres without artificial aid. The atmospheric requirement is listed with the trait and if it is unavailable the creature must make a Difficult (10+) Survival check (END) or fall unconscious. Once unconscious, the creature will asphyxiate in 2D rounds.

**Echolocation (X):** Like bats and dolphins, this species can use sound to navigate. Often found in creatures that hunt at night or in dim/murky or underwater conditions. The echolocation range is listed with the trait. Another animal with Echolocation or Heightened Senses gains DM+2 on Recon checks to detect the animal using echolocation.

**EM Sense (X):** Some creatures are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation, independent of their visual capabilities. This is usually a sensitivity to electrical fields and geomagnetic fields. It could be a navigational adaptation or it could be a sensor for detecting prey in dim or dark conditions. The range is listed with the EM Sense trait.

**Foos:** Legends of the spaceways, the so-called 'foos', have been sighted at the edge of systems in the French and American Arms, always too distant for definitive sensor readings and almost never actually sighted. Witnesses to these events are rarely reliable. On the few occasions where a foo ship has been sighted visually, they are reportedly spherical in shape, with almost insect-like wings. Unfortunately, there are never accurate recordings of these sightings. Interestingly, the reports are unusually consistent, from both the American and French Arms.

**Nightvision:** The creature or being can see well in dim lighting and halves any environmental penalties due to poor lighting conditions. They cannot see in complete darkness, however.

**Tough (+X):** Creatures with the Tough trait are less susceptible to stun and wound effects. They add a modifier equal to their Tough score to their END characteristic for the purposes of determining Stun and wound effects only.

**Unusual Sense (X):** An Unusual sense is any sort of sensory mechanism beyond the typical five (sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste). Echolocation and EM sense are specific examples of this but other senses could conceivably be present. Examples include air pressure sensitivity (like a cat), tremorsense to detect things moving on (or under) the ground and heat sensing like a pit viper. The nature of the sense, and its range, is listed with the Unusual Sense trait.

**Weak (-X):** Creatures with the Weak trait are more susceptible to stun and wound effects. They add a modifier equal to their Weak score to their END characteristic for the purposes of determining Stun and wound effects only.

## Hostile Environments

Of all the worlds encountered so far, only Tirane and Nous Voila have been easily amenable to terrestrial life. All other worlds, with their unique biologies and ecosystems, have presented significant challenges to colonisation. Humans and their domestic animals evolved under a very specific set of conditions and while humanity has spread to every corner of their homeworld, there is still only a very narrow range of conditions it can tolerate.

### Planetary Habitability

Humanity evolved on Earth, which remains the most habitable world for terrestrial life. Even on Earth, although, people are still troubled by allergies, can tolerate only a narrow band of temperature and air pressure, and require a varied diet rich in vitamins, trace minerals and other nutrients. Life on other worlds has evolved along different lines, producing different requirements. Human reactions to alien proteins tend to be either non-existent or lead to massive allergy attacks – alien pollen could result in a hay fever attack that is deadly to some people. Foods may lack nutrients, have unusable nutrients or be toxic. Even basic biochemistry can be different. Getting there is only part of the battle to win a world. Surviving on it can be an even greater challenge.

### Biological Compatibility

While almost all life forms encountered so far have been carbon-based, the degree to which these life forms are compatible with terrestrial life varies. At the most extreme examples the biosphere is completely incompatible due to the twist, or chirality, of complex amino acid, protein and carbohydrate molecules.

Terrestrial life has a left-handed twist to most amino acids, proteins and fats, while sugars and starches mostly have right-hand chirality. On Beta Canum, amino acids and proteins have a right-hand twist, while most sugars and starches are left-handed, the complete opposite of life on Earth. There are a few examples where chirality is more complex and these may be used or adapted, to a degree, as terrestrial food sources. On some worlds, such as Aurore, there are no compatible biochemistries and most life is actively toxic.

**The UPP**

The Universal Planetary Profile (UPP) is a common feature in most of the Traveller universe. The last two entries, 'e' and 'c', are unique to 2300AD, and represent Planetary Adaptation Syndrome (PAS) severity, and the world's biological compatibility, respectively.

UPP codes are found in the following format: **ABCDEFG-H I JKL ec**

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| A | Starport Type |
| B | World Size |
| C | Atmosphere Type |
| D | % Hydrographics |
| E | World Population (all colonies combined, if more than 1) |
| F | World Government Type (if there is more than 1 colony, this will be 7 (Balkanised)) |
| G | Law Level (usually the lowest) |
| H | Tech Level (usually the highest available) |
| I | Bases Present |
| J | Population Multiplier for Mainworld |
| K | Number of Planetoid Belts in System |
| L | Number of Gas Giants in System |
| e | PAS Severity |
| c | Compatibility |

Compatibility is ranked from 0 to 10. A score of 0 indicates non-carbon based life forms. Lower scores indicate largely incompatible organisms that are nonetheless carbon-based. A score of 8 or higher indicates effectively complete compatibility. As a general rule, Compatibility × 10% is the percentage of local life that is safe to eat but even at higher levels of compatibility there may be missing vitamins or allergic reactions. The level of compatibility can also be used to judge the toxicity of imported terrestrial plants and animals (including humans, if they happen to be consumed by local flora, fauna and xenoforoms) to the local biosphere. Local predators eating unfortunate colonists are just as likely to have a negative reaction as colonists sampling that green thing that looks like an apple.

### Planetary Adaptation Syndrome

The 32 colonised worlds encompass a wide array of environments, many out of bounds for unassisted human living. While obvious challenges are easy to identify and at least marginally easier to address, it is the hidden challenges that test human ingenuity.

Planetary Adaptation Syndrome (PAS) is a catch-all term that covers the myriad ways that human physiology and psychology is affected by life in alien environments. Factors that influence PAS include atmospheric contaminants like pollen, dust from organic sources, star colour, temperature, day and season length, and lighting levels, even the quality and texture of dust and dirt can all act to throw the body out of equilibrium. Symptoms of PAS vary from individual-to-individual, and from world-to-world. Some may have only mild reactions, like a touch of a head cold, while in others it can have fatal consequences. Life in stations and sealed habitats does not normally trigger PAS.

A world's PAS score determines the overall severity of PAS effects and is used as a DM on PAS checks. This usually runs from 2 to 7. Note that the PAS DM is always a negative. If PAS is 4, then this becomes DM-4 on the PAS check.

When arriving on-planet, a Traveller should make a PAS check as follows. The time increment is the number of days before the PAS reaction manifests itself. A Traveller can use either Athletics or Survival for the PAS check. If medical treatment or adaptive technologies are available, then the Traveller receives DM+2 on this check.

**The PAS check is a Routine (6+) Athletics or Survival check (1D days, END) with a further DM of the PAS score as a negative.**

The Effect determines the degree to which the Traveller is affected by PAS once they arrive on a new world. If successful, the Traveller suffers only minor symptoms that have no great effect. With an Effect of 4+, the Traveller suffers no effects at all.

On a failure, the Effect is applied as a DM to all checks unless remediation is made, typically either medical treatment or assistive technologies like a filter mask. If such remediation is available, the Traveller can make the PAS check again, this time with DM+2. Success indicates they are no longer unaffected by PAS on that world so long as they continue to use the remediation technologies. These penalties disappear once the Traveller is in a sealed environment for at least two days but will return once they step outside.

PAS checks must be made every time a non-native Traveller comes to a world, even if they have been there before. A Traveller with a DNAM specific to the world does not have to make a PAS check at all.

**Example:** Cold Mountain is known for being unrelentingly-hostile. The PAS level for this world is 7, giving DM-7 on the PAS check. The PAS check is therefore a Routine (6+), Athletics or Survival check (END, DM-7, 1D days).

A Traveller with Athletics (endurance) 1 and END DM+1 rolls an 8 on their PAS check, for a total of 3. They fail with Effect 3 and so will have DM-3 on all checks in 1D days after landing. However, if the proper countermeasures are available, like a filter/decompression mask, the Traveller gets to roll again, this time with DM+2. They roll a total of five this time, so the Effect is -1. They will suffer DM-1 on all checks so long as the mask is available and in place. Otherwise, they will retain the initial DM-3.

### A Matter of Gravity

Planetary Adaptation Syndrome deals with most major acclimatisation requirements of hostile new worlds. Gravity, and its effects, is a different matter.

The inhabited worlds and outposts have considerable variation in their gravity. While most larger habitats are spun to simulate Earth-normal gravity, smaller and/or more distant stations will often have lower effective gravities, either for size/space reasons, costs or because nearby worlds have lower gravity. Most orbital stations, for example, spin to simulate the surface gravity of the planet they orbit.

**Effects of Gravity Changes**

Whenever a Traveller transitions from one gravity regime to the next, they require an acclimatisation period. During this period of time, they suffer DM-1 to all DEX-based checks for each level of difference in gravity, as shown on the Gravity Regimes table. Each step also reduces their speed by one metre.

The maximum difference, going from Zero-gravity to Extreme, would therefore inflict DM-4 to all DEX-based checks, along deducting four metres from the Travellers' speed.

Acclimatisation requires an Average (8+) Athletics check (END, 1D days). If the Traveller enters a gravity two levels different, then this check increases to Difficult (10+). If the change is three or more levels different, then the check is Very Difficult (12+).

Conversely, each level down from a Traveller's homeworld gravity grants DM+1 to all Athletics checks, along with a +1 metre increase to their speed.

| Step | Gravity Regime | Gravity Range |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | Zero-gravity | 0.0–0.10 |
| 2 | Low | 0.11–0.80 |
| 3 | Normal | 0.81–1.20 |
| 4 | High | 1.21–2.10 |
| 5 | Extreme | 2.11+ |

**Zero Gravity**

Zero or micro-gravity is unlike any other environment. Time spent in zero-gravity can have long-term health effects, including muscle and bone density loss, nausea, changes in the fluid system and an odd, although typically short-term, loss of proprioception. Proprioception is having a sense of where one's limbs are in relation to each other and the body. As one Traveller described it: 'I suddenly realised that I had lost track of... my arms and legs. For all my mind could tell, my limbs were not there.'

*Short Term Effects*

Exposure to zero gravity can have almost immediate effects. In addition to DM-1 on DEX-based checks that all Travellers suffer when they change gravity regimes, Travellers must make an Average (8+) Athletics check (END). If the check fails, the Traveller becomes nauseated, suffers DM-1 to all checks. This is cumulative with the DM-1 for changing gravity regimes. Travellers with the Free Fall DNAM do not need to make this check.

*Long Term Effects*

After two weeks, a Traveller must make another Average (8+) Athletics check (END) to avoid permanent long-term effects. Dedicated exercise equipment grants DM+1 for every two hours spent exercising each day. The presence of spin gravity above 0.5 Gs negates the need for the check entirely. Travellers with the Free Fall DNAM receive DM+6 on this check.

*Zero Gravity Movement*

Movement in zero gravity is unlike any other, even swimming. While it is possible to 'swim' in air, the motion is slow and tiring. This swimming motion has a speed of STR × 0.01 metres. A STR 7 Traveller could therefore 'swim' at a speed of 0.07 metres.

Fortunately, there are other methods. The most common is to push off another object, including walls and floors. This is much faster and is equal to a speed of STR × 1 metres. A STR 7 Traveller could push themselves at 7 metres, faster than normal walking speed.

Most spacecraft also have hand-holds, inside and out, and a Traveller can just pull themselves along. It is possible to develop a fair rate of speed doing this. Speed this way can reach a maximum of STR × 2 metres.

Many larger vessels also have powered zip lines, cables with handholds that a Traveller can grab and be pulled along by. These have the advantage of providing a braking capability when it comes time to stop.

Gas guns are another common choice, usually in the form of a hand-held device that consists of a compressor, storage tank and air jet, all controlled by a single variable trigger.

The last common option for movement in zero-gee is the use of magnetic or gekkocote boots, allowing the Traveller to stick to decks and move in a relatively normal fashion. The practice is very common for inexperienced Travellers and for work in dangerous environments.

*Stopping and Bouncing*

Stopping in zero gravity can be a problem. Unless a zip line or gas gun is being used, there are no brakes. Travellers will hit the wall, another object or someone else at the speed they launched themselves at.

It is possible to absorb some of the inertia on impact with a Difficult (10+) Athletics (dexterity) check (DEX). If the check is failed, the Effect is the speed at which the Traveller bounces off in a random direction. They will also suffer D3 Stun damage, ignoring armour. Should two Travellers collide, they can bounce off each other as well or attempt to grab hold of one another with a Difficult (10+) Athletics (dexterity) or Melee (DEX) check.

### Disease and Parasites

While 3V documentaries get made about Beowulf's dracoforms and Cold Mountain's demons, it is the threats that cannot be seen that present the greatest danger to humans, their crops and their livestock. Roughly half of all colonial fatalities are due to a combination of disease, parasites, and other infections. Modern medical technologies can usually cure these infections but only if noticed and treated in time. Note that most automeds can usually do little more than buy time, as they are not programmed for complex diagnoses of diseases not in their meta-bases. Those require a human doctor working with the automed's expert system and all of the other diagnostic equipment modern medical technology can bring to bear. Unfortunately, on many worlds, this level of technology may not be readily available.

Any world with an active biosphere can harbour diseases and infections inimical to humans, even if the lifeforms are typically incompatible. Diseases are covered on page 76 of the Traveller Core Book.

**Parasites, Diseases, and Fungal Infections**

There are many diseases found across the Core and the worlds of the Frontier. Those here describe a few of the more common or notable diseases.

**DARK LUNG**

While the ecology of Dunkelheim can best be described as 'shattered', there is life. The kamelinsekt is the most successful of these lifeforms and their hives harbour a number of other organisms, from creatures the size of small mice to an active microbiology. It is the latter that causes dark lung. Dark lung is a fungus that reproduces by releasing spores; these spores are active, with flagellate tails that propel them up to a few hundred metres from where they were released, much like the zoospores of some slime moulds on Earth. If the spores fall on skin, they are usually harmless but if they reach the lungs, the warm and moist conditions trigger growth of the organism. It slowly spreads through the lungs, decreasing efficiency and eventually killing the infected person or animal. Luckily, the infection is easy enough to treat once spotted but there have been recent reports of a new strain resistant to the current treatment regimen.

**GLASS MITES**

Another one of the horrors visited upon colonists to Han Shan (Cold Mountain), the glass mite is a small parasite about the size of a grain of sand. The adult form is unable to move on its own and is instead transported by the frequent and violent winds that wrack the colonised area of the planet. Glass mites have no effect unless they are either breathed in or enter an open wound. Once inside a Traveller, the mites lay eggs. These eggs hatch within 12 hours into clutches of microscopic worms that start to feed and grow. These worms are segmented, like a tapeworm, and as they grow, shed segments. Within animal tissue these segments turn into more worms and once they reach open air the segments drop off. Within two days the shed segments create another batch of glass mites.

**INFLUENZA**

The bane of humanity's existence, constantly-mutating influenza has resisted all attempts at eradication and even control is not very effective. The introduction of the disease to distant worlds has simply increased the rate of mutation, resulting in periodic outbreaks that sweep human space. While the efforts of the Orbital Quarantine Command have prevented major outbreaks from reaching Earth, occasionally off-world varieties find their way to the homeworld.

**KERAROT**

The hair and nails of most terrestrial species are made up of keratin, a tough protein-based material. Kerarot, a fungal infection occasionally encountered near the oceans and shorelines of the world of Montana, attacks these proteins. Over the course of a few days to a couple of weeks, the infection attacks and breaks down the protein, reducing nails and hair to a frothy, bubbly mess. While the infection is not usually very dangerous, with only one recorded death attributed to it, it is very uncomfortable, with constant itchiness and a foul odour. It also looks quite disgusting. If diagnosed early enough it is easily-cured, although the subjects tend to lose all their hair and nails until they grow back.

| Disease | END Check Difficulty | Damage | Interval |
|---------|----------------------|--------|----------|
| Dark Lung | Average (8+) | 2D, -1 metre speed and DM-1 to all Athletics checks | 1D weeks |
| Glass Mites | Difficult (10+) | 3D and DM-1 to all END-based checks | 2D hours |
| Influenza | Routine (6+) | 1D-2 and DM-1 to all checks | 1D days |
| Kerarot | Average (8+) | 1D-4 and DM-1 to all checks | 1D weeks |
| Sludge Skin | Routine (6+) | 2D and DM-1 to all checks | 1D days |
| Wasting Plague | Formidable (14+) | 3D, -2 metres speed and DM-2 to all Athletics checks | 3D hours |

**PEAU DE BOUE (SLUDGE SKIN)**

This is a condition that occasionally develops on Kimanjano among long-haul crew on skimmer ships. While it is not a disease, as the substances from Kimanjnao's oceans cannot properly be described as alive, it nonetheless has the effect of an infection. Some of the biomass scooped up by the ships can have a negative effect on exposed tissue, adhering to the skin and slowly absorbed. The sludge causes no pain as it is absorbed but once within flesh, it starts to destroy the surrounding tissue, rapidly creating a pool of liquid just under the skin that slowly eats its way through. It appears as drops of sludge on the exposed tissue. While this can be fatal, it is usually caught quickly. The treatment is not difficult but is painful as the affected tissue must be cut away and regenerated. In extreme cases, a limb may have to be removed and replaced with a prosthetic.

**WASTING PLAGUE**

In the early years of the colonisation of Nous Voila a virulent plague broke out in the colony. Despite quarantine efforts, the disease spread to two other worlds before being contained and cured. Casualties in the Nous Voila colony were nearly 50% and the colony came close to being abandoned. This viral epidemic damaged cellular mitochondria, resulting in an impaired ability to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the source of energy in a cell. Without ATP, cells would literally starve and die, leading to the subject slowly wasting away, despite adequate nutrients.

## Terragens

Terragens is a term used to denote lifeforms of Earth origin. The term applies to all terrestrial life, including animals, as well as intelligent and proto-intelligent beings and uplifts.

### Section 2: Starship Crews

**Belters**

Although not common, there are Belter communities throughout human space, although the largest is still in the Sol system. Most Belters will be armed, although the weapons will not be immediately obvious. They tend to be clannish and stick together.

### Section 4: Neos

Neos are genetically-altered animals, created to serve as companions to humans on hazardous colony worlds. There is considerable controversy surrounding neos, as they all have near-human range intelligence, yet are effectively enslaved through bio-chemical imprinting. The North American Research League (NARL) has long campaigned for their production to be stopped. Oddly enough, the Life Foundation, usually an ardent supporter of the rights of living things, does not support banning the production of neos, just of tighter controls over who can get one and improved monitoring of their living conditions.

**Neo-Cats**

Neo-cats are extremely large for a domestic cat, using the savannah cat as base stock. Neo-cats are faster than their progenitors and as smart as a neo-dog, with similar linguistic skills. Like the neo-dog, they are bio-chemically imprinted for a specific individual during their creation.

| ANIMAL | HITS | SPEED |

| **Skills** | Athletics (dexterity) 1, Recon 1, Stealth 3 | |
| **Attacks** | Claws (1D) | |
| **Traits** | Heightened Senses, Small (-1) | |
| **Behaviour** | Carnivore, Pouncer | |

**Neo-Dog**

The neo-dog was created from German Shepard stock. The alterations are subtle, mostly enhancing the animal's intelligence and sense of smell. A neo-dog can understand about 400 words and speak 50–80. They can be trained far quicker than an unaugmented animal and are designed to bond based on smell; a neo-dog is decanted with a specific person already imprinted.

| ANIMAL | HITS | SPEED |

| **Attacks** | Bite (2D) | |
| **Traits** | Heightened Senses, Small (-1) | |
| **Behaviour** | Carnivore, Chaser | |

**Neo-Fins**

Neo-fins are dolphins trapped somewhere between their wild ancestors and fully-uplifted dolphins (chirukas). They are not fully sapient but also no longer 'dumb' animals; by far the smartest of the neos, they have the most trouble adapting. Neo-fins are not biochemically-bonded to their handler and lack the echolocation abilities of their wild kin, a side-effect of the failed imprinting process. This makes them even more dependent on humans and human technology, and cybernetic echolocation systems have been made available to some neo-fins, allowing them at least a vestige of the sonic world their ancestors enjoyed. The plight of the neo-fins is the subject of a massive law suit brought by NARL against Pacifica BioLogica, their creator. NARL claims the Kigali Accords are supposed to prevent this sort of abuse of proto-intelligences.

| **Attacks** | Ram (2D) | |
| **Traits** | Aquatic/1, Heightened Senses, Large (+1) | |
| **Behaviour** | Carnivore/Chaser | |

**Neo-Octopus**

Although unable to operate out of water, the neo-octopus has proven extremely useful, in large part for its ability to use tools underwater. Unlike other neos, the neo-octopus cannot speak, although understands as many words. Instead, the neo-octopus communicates through colour changes and pattern changes. Neo-octopuses are not biochemically bonded to their handlers but seem to genuinely enjoy human company. They do not die after reproducing, unlike most wild octopuses but part of the genetic engineering process affected their reproductive drive, and as a result neo-octopuses can only reproduce with external assistance.

| Neo-Octopus | 5 | 0m (aquatic) |

| **Attacks** | Beak (D2-1) | |
| **Traits** | Aquatic/1, Heightened Senses, Large (+1) | |
| **Behaviour** | Carnivore, Pouncer | |

**Neo-Raven**

Using the large northern raven as base stock, the neo-raven is the fastest, and one of the smartest, of the neos. It has the best speech capabilities of any, with a spoken vocabulary roughly triple that of a neo-dog. Many neo-ravens are fitted with cybernetic eyes that can transmit what they see to their handler.

| ANIMAL | HITS | SPEED |
|--------|------|-------|
| Neo-Raven | 5 | 4m |

| **Attacks** | Beak (D3-1) | |
| **Traits** | Flyer (slow), Heightened Senses, Small (-3) | |
| **Behaviour** | Scavenger, Carrion-eater | |

### Section 5: Proto-Intelligences

Under the terms of the Kigali Accords on Non-Human Intelligence, a proto-intelligence meets the criteria for intelligence, including possessing reflective self-awareness, but not to the same degree as humans. Proto-intelligences are therefore granted a certain set of rights, including the right to freedom of person, the right to life and several other 'human' rights. However, under the terms of the Kigali Accords, proto-intelligences are legally incompetent and thus wards of the state. Their rights can be infringed to a degree to protect them and others but not without tribunal. Crimes committed against proto-intelligences carry the same weight as crimes committed against humans and incur the same penalties. However, as wards of the state, proto-intelligences cannot be prosecuted for their actions against humans, except in very special circumstances.

**Birds**

The corvids, which include crows and ravens, are widely-considered to be the smartest of birds, with problem solving abilities equivalent to a 10-year-old human. Many species of parrots are likewise protected under the Kigali Accords.

| ANIMAL | HITS | SPEED |
|--------|------|-------|

| **Attacks** | Beak (1) | |
| **Traits** | Flyer (very slow), Heightened Sense, Small (-3) | |
| **Behaviour** | Omnivore, Scavenger | |

**Cephalopods**

Several species of cephalopod appear to meet the criteria for protection as proto-intelligences. Most cephalopods are trapped in a dead-end, in that they die while waiting for their young to hatch, and so have no opportunity to create or transmit culture. Foremost amongst these proto-intelligences are the giant pacific octopus and the Humboldt (red devil) squid.

The arms of a Humboldt squid are capable of pinning a target. This is a grapple (see page 74 of the Traveller Core Rulebook), for which the squid gains DM+4.

| **Traits** | Aquatic/3, Camouflaged, Heightened Senses | |
| **Behaviour** | Carnivore, Killer | |

**Cetaceans**

Most cetacean species are recognised as proto-intelligences, including the larger whales, orcas and most dolphins. Almost all cetaceans are protected under law, although some smaller species are not, having been assessed to lack the reflective self-awareness required.

| ANIMAL | HITS | SPEED |

| **Traits** | Aquatic/1, Echolocation (50m), Heightened Senses, Large (+3) | |
| **Behaviour** | Carnivore, Chaser | |

**Elephants**

Indian elephants staged a comeback during Twilight, while African elephants continued to falter. The Kigali Treaty and subsequent legal reforms finally pulled the African elephant back from extinction. Unlike most animals, the elephant is able to effectively manipulate its environment with its long, flexible trunk. A few were exported to Chengdu before Manchuria signed the Kigali Accords, where they have adapted well to life near human settlements.

| **Traits** | Heightened Senses, Large (+4) | |
| **Behaviour** | Herbivore, Grazer | |

**Great Apes**

All of the great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos, orangutans and gibbons) are protected as proto-intelligences. Some, in particular the orangutan, are endangered in their natural habitat but there are sufficient numbers in alternative habitats that they are not considered endangered overall.

| ANIMAL | HITS | SPEED |

| **Behaviour** | Omnivore, Gatherer | |

### Section 6: Domesticated Animals

Wherever settlers go, animals tend to follow. This is a selection of domesticated animals commonly seen across the Core and Frontier.

**Cat**

The domestic cat is a common sight on many Frontier worlds, both for its ability to control pests and companionship. As local life-forms can be toxic to terrestrial animals, care must be taken when introducing cats to a colony world. As supremely efficient predators of small animals, they can have a negative effect on local ecosystems near colony sites and homesteads.

| **Traits** | Heightened Senses, Small (-3) | |
| **Behaviour** | Carnivore, Pouncer | |

**Dog**

This is standard large-breed dog, like a Rottweiler or German Shepherd, very common on Frontier worlds as household pets and guard animals. Like horses, they usually undergo genetic engineering to adapt to new worlds.

| ANIMAL | HITS | SPEED |
|--------|------|-------|
| Large Dog | 11 | 12m |

| **Traits** | Heightened Senses, Small (-1) | |
| **Behaviour** | Carnivore/Chaser | |

**Horse**

The horse is ubiquitous on new colonies, as a (more or less) self-repairing, self-replicating mode of transportation. Although they are often superseded by mechanised transport after a generation or so, rural areas still make use of them when local conditions allow. Horses are often engineered to survive more easily.

## Referee Resources

This chapter provides some additional guidelines and ideas, including sections on campaign types, goals and motivations, and sources of conflict in the universe of 2300AD.

2300AD is a game of hard-science fiction in the not-so-distant future. This should be kept in mind as new adventures are being planned. There are no energy swords, giant robots or psionic madmen in the 2300AD universe. A good source for inspiration for 2300AD is the day's news, which can provide plot hooks, atmosphere and ideas for many types of campaigns.

### Campaign Types

The universe of 2300AD, although not as huge as the Third Imperium universe, is still a vast expanse of space that contains a huge variety of worlds to explore. In addition to those worlds already settled by humanity, there are alien planets, unexplored star systems and new worlds just waiting to be investigated.

Any theme can be explored as part of 2300AD but there are several that define this universe.

**Exploration and Alien Contact**

Exploration campaigns take a great deal of preparation. New systems have to be described and planned, worlds mapped, alien societies and cultures created. With this sort of campaign, although, there is a feeling of accomplishment at the end of a session. New things were found and new puzzles solved. These campaigns are less focused on action and more on adventure, so require greater work to establish atmosphere and provide challenges.

There are a few areas of 2300AD space ideal for an exploration-style campaign, including the Frontiers of the French Arm and the far end of the Manchurian Arm.

A referee might consider these ideas:
- The Travellers are hired by an offshoot branch of the Academia del Lincei to travel to an uninhabited system on the Chinese Arm, where there may be ancient Eber ruins on an airless world. They will have to search the system for possible sites but on one of the moons of a gas giant their ground-search radar picks up the regular outlines of an artificial structure. It could be the ancient Eber base or just a mining camp – or even a hidden pirate base.
- The Transhuman League wants to sponsor an expedition to the abandoned outpost at Van Maanen's Star. They plan to survey the system with an eye to creating a colony of transhumanists, far from the prying eyes of Earth nations and research bans.
- Labyrinth is a rare find, an inhabitable world just off the regular travel lanes of the French Arm. The world has not even been fully surveyed from orbit and the vast system of trenches that give the world its name have barely been visited and only by robots.

**Mercenaries**

Ground combat in 2300AD can involve low-intensity warfare against colonial rebels, high-intensity conflict against Kaefers or high-intensity combat versus other human nations. The first is the most common and generates a wide range of opportunities for small-unit operations.

This kind of campaign is popular, as it has a great deal of action. It is wise to intersperse combat with some other sort of action, such as an investigation in barracks. Changing the enemy and the mission often also helps to keep things fresh.

A referee might consider these ideas:
- On the world of Heidelsheimat, the Texan and German colonies are involved in a territorial dispute over the series of islands between the two. These islands had largely been ignored by both colonies until the chance discovery of oil. Texas sees oil as the solution for their over-extended economy and a way to make the colony pay for itself. In a similar vein, Heidelsheimat sees the oil resources as key to their own survival and vital to whether they accept German hegemony or declare independence. Both colonies are advancing their claims and Texas has begun active recruiting to beef up the limited number of Department of Public Safety troops currently available on the world.
- Heidelsheimat has recently hired Manchurian mercenaries, along with their combat walkers and support equipment. Travellers could be hired on either side and war could be imminent.
- Iran is always hiring mercenaries to patrol its more inhospitable regions and for special forces work. It is involved in a border dispute with Iraq, which has gone deep into debt to hire a cadre of French mercenaries, mostly armour and artillery. It looks like the border dispute might heat up once more.

**Space Military**

Space combat can enter a campaign in two different ways. In most campaigns, it will be another sort of encounter, played through as the Travellers journey to the real goal of the campaign. In a space military campaign, however, combat is the focus of the game.

Travellers will be crew aboard a vessel or each Traveller could take on the role of a ship's captain, commanding several vessels between them in an ongoing campaign.

This second type of campaign is more of a running wargame and would require rules for resupply and repair (the Element Class Cruisers: Shipbuilder's Blueprints box set is perfect for this). Notes should be taken of traditional allies and rivals when deciding what nations will re-provision a ship. Typically, a colony must have at least a Class B starport to support and repair modern military vessels.

A referee might consider these ideas:
- A small group of pirates is preying on commercial shipping between Cold Mountain and the colony on Chengdu and Manchurian authorities have offered a bounty on the pirates.
- The American Space Force has decided to move in and clean up pirates in and around a system near Ellis.
- The Royal Space Navy at Beowulf is making a move on belters 'squatting' in the system's asteroid belt. The belters have armed mining boats, however, and the mix of stutterwarp and efficient reaction drives gives them an unpredictable edge. The navy is looking to clear the miners out before the Melbourne Accords Disputes Tribunal rules on the intercession from Indonesia on the belters' behalf.

**Troubleshooting**

Troubleshooting campaigns often revolve around a combination of mystery and violence. Troubleshooters are hired to solve problems, often corporate in nature, but troubleshooting adventures can encompass just about any sort of job. Usually set on a Frontier world, a troubleshooting campaign requires a strong mix of skills and abilities. Although Travellers can often draw on the resources of the nation, corporation or foundation that hired them, they still must exercise discretion and be able to operate on their own when necessary.

A referee might consider these ideas:
- Parts are going missing at an orbital shipyard and outside consultants are brought in by the head office to investigate.
- A corporation is having union troubles on a distant mining outpost and investigators are brought in to get dirt on the union leaders.
- A foundation is concerned by unusual reports from a distant science outpost located on a sparsely-populated colony. The Travellers are hired to travel to the outpost and find out what, if anything, is going on.

**Trade and Commerce**

Although a staple of Traveller, a trade and commerce campaign is more difficult to implement in 2300AD, as it is more marginal. Most larger shipping concerns are subsidised by the national governments, allowing them to turn a profit. Interface costs in particular are often partly or even wholly underwritten by governments. Most Libertine traders do the larger portion of their business with orbital stations and asteroid bases, where interface costs are negligible to none or else somebody else's problem.

A referee might consider these ideas:
- Ferrying industrial equipment to, and luxury foodstuffs from, a world like Montana in the Chinese Arm or Ellis in the American Arm could prove most lucrative.
- A ship is carrying supplies to Aurore, including several tons of pay-dirt, used to create soil friendly to Terran life-forms. It is also carrying a large amount of surplus military equipment for the Tanstaafl Colonial Militia and more advanced weapons for the Tanstaafl Free Legion.
- The Travellers are crew aboard the Libertine transport Star of Gabriel, en route to Paulo. Along the way it takes on passengers who are part of the Interstellar Circus, who were abandoned by the circus fleet when they ended up in jail after a particularly raucous, and alcohol-fuelled, binge. The seven performers are a mixture of clowns and carnies, and liable to be quite the handful. Since Star of Gabriel is not Tong-affiliated, it may run into problems with Tongs along the way.

**Counterterrorism**

The counterterrorism campaign is a hard, dark game to play, as it delves into the ultra-violent world of 2300AD terrorism, with its unwilling cyborgs and casual disregard for human life. The terrorists of 2300AD are advocates of a variety of causes, from ultra-environmentalists to nihilistic religious cults, ProVolution and its augmented agents to the Children of Mao and their knives. All share the common characteristic of being utterly devoted to their cause and the belief that it is the best thing for all humanity.

Counterterrorist operations are not just concerned with killing terrorists. Individual terrorists are not as dangerous as the support networks organisations create and the primary goal of counter-terrorist operations is the discovery and neutralisation of these networks.

A referee might consider these ideas:
- ProVolution has announced that they have let loose a walking nuclear bomb in Tokyo. Authorities have 12 hours to find the bomb, and neutralise it, or else a 100-kiloton device will go off somewhere in Tokyo. Thing is, the carrier of the bomb does not even know it. ProVolution kidnapped him off the street, drugged him, implanted the device and turned him loose.
- Terrorists have taken hostages at the local offices of the Trilon corporation and are demanding the usual (freedom of prisoners, withdrawal of troops) but no one knows who exactly they are. This adventure could go two ways; investigate the group, or go in and try to take them down. Investigation will reveal that the group does not exist and are simply being used as a blind to confuse the authorities while the 'terrorists' (actually spies for a rival firm) go through Trilon's files and vaults, stealing whatever they can.
- ProVolution has seized a spaceplane, grabbing it just before take-off. They managed to get implanted weapons through the spaceport's security grid and are now threatening to kill one hostage an hour until their demands are met. They want the American and Canadian governments to release all records on the King Ultra DNA modification project, which are still sealed after more than 100 years.

### Sources of Conflict

Conflict and struggle are at the heart of adventure. There are several general themes of conflict in the 2300AD universe, all of which can be used as the underlying basis for many adventures.

**Core vs. Frontier**

The Frontier challenges the Core, with the oft-repeated charge that the Core is out of touch with rapidly changing events on the Frontier. Often the goals of Core-based governments, Foundations and corporations are at odds with the reality on the Frontier. At the same time, the Frontier does not realise what a balancing act maintaining the extrasolar colonies is, as the Core worlds have to allocate a limited tax base not only to the population at home, where the majority of the votes come from, but also a disproportionate amount which goes to maintaining the colonies. Recent opinion polls in many colonising nations reflect a growing disillusionment with colonies and a desire to see the colonies pay more of their own way.

**Organisations vs. Independents**

There are many organisations in 2300AD that strive to exert control over individuals, colonies and nations. Foremost of these are the nations themselves. Although their influence is waning in the face of the other organisations, nations still maintain the lion's share of power and their citizens are subject to the exercise of that power, whether for good or ill. Foundations are another level of organisation, increasingly independent and focused on their own goals. Finally, as a counter-balance to national control, there are the multi-national corporations, which are becoming as powerful as nations and in the case of Trilon and a few others, are on the verge of becoming independent nations in their own right.

All of these groups seek the attention and loyalty of others, and to exert control for the purpose of fulfilling their goals. For many, this is exactly what they want, a place to belong. For others, however, the reality is different. They do not fit in and largely do not want to. These independents resist the encroachment of the establishment onto their turf, often forcibly.

**Hard Path vs. Soft Path**

While the division between the two guiding philosophies in interstellar colonisation has not led to direct violence, the two ways of thinking are becoming increasingly incompatible. At the extremes, each faction is starting to regard the other as freaks or losers. This split often appears to be supported and encouraged by major media networks, seeing the growing ideological conflict as a way to attract viewers.

**Humans vs. Aliens**

This is not necessarily active conflict but the interests of humans and alien species often clash. Individual aliens may or may not share their species' overarching goals but it is rare (although possible) to find one that will advance humanity's goals ahead of their own species. Examples of the issues facing human-alien interaction include:

*Pentapod Factionalism:* There are many factions in Pentapod society, most of which do not work well together. There are, however, several axes in Pentapod society that the various factions tend to align themselves with such as pro-human, in favour of continued good relations with humanity, and anti-human, which favour, at the least, breaking off contact with humanity, and include those factions who favour using Pentapod biotechnology to 'remake' humans in a more useful form. The greater part of Pentapod factions are neutral, with little interest in humanity at all.

*Sung Demands under Sos-Soon-Atkacharr:* Although the Slaver War ended over 40 years ago, the Sung still have not been brought up to as advanced a level as they feel they are entitled to under the provisions of the treaties signed with human forces and by the rules governing conduct under Sos-Soon-Atkacharr. They have started to agitate for an increased rate of technology transfers, while at the same time protesting over how little humanity has worked for their new benefits.

*The Kaefers:* Although the level of threat they represent is unknown, the very fact of an advanced and hostile alien species is a threat that must be taken seriously. Unfortunately, the great distance and communications lag involved in military efforts at the edge of human space have hampered these efforts.

**Transhumanists vs. Baselines**

ProVolution is simply the violent end of the spectrum that encompasses the so-called Transhumanists. They believe humanity now has the tools to overcome its limitations and want to make use of these tools. Cybernetics, genetics, DNA modification and artificial intelligence are all seen as enabling technologies, and Transhumanists want to see restrictions on these technologies lifted, with new research initiated.

The majority of people are afraid of Transhumanist ideals and the idea that humanity can (or should) be transformed by technology into something more. Stories of what happened on Tristan de la Cunha Island and contact with the Pentapods have hardened public opinion on human augmentation, especially genetic augmentation.

Most Transhumanists protest peaceably, making plans and grandiose predictions, while some few plot to bring down the old order and remake it in their favour. Transhumanists have a tendency to embrace new technologies and many have cybernetics or implants of some kind, even illegal implants, although usually not weapons. Of any major extra-governmental organisation, the Life Foundation in particular seems to attract many Transhumanists.

**National Rivalries**

Despite the chaos and destruction of the Kaefer War, national rivalries and conflicts continue to dominate human affairs. The current cold war between Argentina and Brazil is a good (and long-running) example of this. The many nations of Earth still struggle for dominance and the practice of dividing nations into Tiers further exacerbates the conflicts, as Tier 3 and Tier 4 nations struggle to prove they are better and Tier 5 and 6 nations struggle to simply survive. The national rivalries listed on page 10 form a good starting point but any world shared by two or more nations can spark a struggle. Witness the escalating tensions on Heidelsheimat between the Bavarian and Texan colonists over mineral resources, or on Beowulf between the French and British over fishing rights, or between the Australians and Japanese on Tirane over disputed borders. National conflict appears to be inevitable.
