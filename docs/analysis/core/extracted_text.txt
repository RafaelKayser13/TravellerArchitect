T R A V E L L E R
On our small planet, at this moment, here we face a
critical branch point in history. What we do with our planet,
right now, will propagate down through the centuries and
powerfully affect the destiny of our descendants.
It is well within our power to destroy our civilisation
and, perhaps, our species as well. If we capitulate to
superstition, greed or stupidity, we can plunge our world
into a darkness deeper than the time between the collapse
of classical civilisation and the Italian renaissance.
But we are also capable of using our compassion and
our intelligence, our technology and our wealth, to create
an abundant and meaningful life for every inhabitant of
this planet. To enhance enormously our understanding
of the universe, and to carry us to the stars...

Noble Titles
may be very well known on their world and possibly across vast
swathes of Charted Space. However, while the Third Imperium Social Standing Possible Titles
maintains a system of nobility recognised across most of its 11 Knight

many duties and obligations that may preclude them from a life of 14 Count
adventure. After all, a typical duke will reign over many worlds and 15 Duke
Travellers will generally want to explore the universe rather than
be engaged in constant administration.
If the group includes a Traveller with a high SOC, we recommend one of the following courses:
• Sons, daughters and more distant relations to a named noble may carry a great deal of social weight
without actually having a title themselves (although they may well inherit later, depending on how far
down the line of succession they are).
• The Traveller may well be a high-ranking noble – but has been deposed or otherwise ousted from their
position. Perhaps they will someday regain their seat or maybe they will spend the rest of their life trying
to escape those who removed them.
• SOC need not be tied to nobility – celebrities will also command a high score in this characteristic.
A Traveller’s career might point the way to why a SOC is so high, perhaps as a war hero or famous
writer. However, it is also possible that the Traveller is simply known for being known, much like some
celebrities in our own world.
If a title is desired, the Noble Titles table provides a suitable link between specific noble titles and SOC.

EVENTS DURING PRE-CAREER EDUCATION
For any term a Traveller spends in pre-career
education, roll on the Pre-career Events table. As with
career events, other Travellers may be linked to with
the connections rule – perhaps they even spent time in
the same university or academy!
If drafted through an event, enter the new career next
term but do not graduate. This (and similar effects) can
cause a Traveller to be drafted more than once.
Pre-Career Events
2D Event
2 You are approached by an underground (and highly illegal) psionic group who sense potential in you. You
may test your PSI and attempt to enter the Psion career in any subsequent term, (see page 236).
3 Your time in education is not a happy one and you suffer a deep tragedy; perhaps you become hopelessly
addicted to drink or drugs, a failed romance leaves you in tatters or a fatal accident involving a close friend
shakes your confidence. You crash and fail to graduate.
4 A supposedly harmless prank goes wrong and someone gets hurt, physically or emotionally. Roll SOC 8+.
If you succeed, gain a Rival. If you fail, gain an Enemy. If you roll 2, you fail to graduate and must take the
Prisoner career in your next term.
5 Taking advantage of youth, you party as much as you study. Gain Carouse 1.
6 You become involved in a tightly knit clique or group and make a pact to remain friends forever, wherever
in the galaxy you may end. Gain D3 Allies.
7 Life Event. Roll on the Life Events table (see page 46).
8 You join a political movement. Roll SOC 8+. If successful, you become a leading figure. Gain one Ally
within the movement but gain one Enemy in wider society.
9 You develop a healthy interest in a hobby or other area of study. Gain any skill of your choice, with the
exception of Jack-of-all-Trades, at level 0.
10 A newly arrived tutor rubs you up the wrong way and you work hard to overturn their conclusions. Roll 9+
on any skill you have learned during this term. If successful, you provide a truly elegant proof that soon
becomes accepted as the standard approach. Gain a level in the skill you rolled on and the tutor as a Rival.
11 War comes and a wide-ranging draft is instigated. You can either flee and join the Drifter career next term
or be drafted (roll 1D: 1–3 Army, 4–5 Marine, 6 Navy). Either way, you do not graduate this term. However,
if you roll SOC 9+, you can get enough strings pulled to avoid the draft and complete your education – you
may attempt graduation normally and are not drafted.
12 You gain wide-ranging recognition of your initiative and innovative approach to study. Increase your SOC by +1.

Vargr Canines
VARGR
The Vargr are the only Major Race to have been
uplifted by the Ancients, a fact that the Vargr are
extremely proud of. They are typically seen by other
species as aggressive pirates and scavengers but the
Vargr actually have a diverse culture that is deeply
rooted in their pack mentality and the desire for
companionship, charisma and loyalty. Their constant
struggle for charisma and leadership results in a culture
fuelled by conflict and change.
The Vargr are descended from carnivore/chaser
stock; genetically engineered by the Ancients circa
-300,000 from the genus Canis. The carnivores were
transplanted from Terra to Lair/Grnouf in the Provence
sector. The Vargr bear a close resemblance to their
canine ancestry, as can be seen by their muzzle, tail
and fur, although several anatomical modifications were
made by the Ancients to the canine body structure.
Vargr adopt a digitigrade stance (putting their weight on
their toes rather than the soles of their feet) and many
have a slight stoop.
Characteristics
Vargr Travellers have the following modifiers applied to
their characteristics: STR-1, DEX+1, END-1.
Traits
Vargr Travellers all possess the following traits:
Bite: All Vargr possess pronounced canines, which
make for a nasty close combat weapon. This bite uses
the Melee (natural) skill and does 1D+1 damage.
Heightened Senses: Vargr have better
hearing and sense of smell than humans.
All Vargr receive DM+1 to any Recon
and Survival checks they have to make.
However, their eyesight is worse in darkness
and they suffer DM-1 to any

Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armour can

damage from the outside in – damage that gets
through the outer layer of armour is next applied to the
inner layer.
Some armours have a required skill. A Traveller suffers
DM-1 to all checks taken in the armour per missing
skill level. For example, a Traveller with Vacc Suit skill
0 who is in a suit that requires Vacc Suit 2 would have
DM-2 to all their checks. Not having the skill at all
inflicts the usual DM-3 unskilled penalty instead.
Radiation is a very present danger to many Travellers,
whether in combat or exploration. Some armour
provides a measure of defence against radiation, as
noted in the Rad column of the armour table. This
amount is deducted from the rads a Traveller receives
every time they are exposed to radiation.

While technology is capable of significantly altering and
improving the body, obvious cybernetic, genetic or surgical
alteration of the human form is frowned upon in many universes.
While humans can be altered to survive on hostile worlds
– denizens of a waterworld might be given gills and finger-
webbing, while those living on a world with dangerous native
micro-organisms might have their immune and digestive
systems altered to compensate – unnecessary augmentation
is seen as unpleasant and even perverse in many cultures.
There are some worlds where genetic alteration or cybernetics
are widespread or even mandatory, just as there are worlds
where they are strictly forbidden.
Most of the items in this category can be cybernetic
(mechanical or electronic implants and prostheses) or
biological (genetic engineering and surgical alternation)
or both (a more common solution) but the general term of
‘augment’ is used for all of them.

• If you are just using the computer for general tasks,
then all you need is a basic Interface/0.

to 2 levels below its optimum TL as a prototype (or
reverse engineered experiment) or as a substandard

TL at normal values but cost and mass are multiplied
by 10 for construction at one TL lower and 100 for
construction at two TL lower.
For example, a TL10 Computer/2 salvaged from a
mysterious alien wreck could be used to reverse engineer
a Computer/2 by a TL8 society. It would run as a TL10
Computer/2, but would cost Cr50000 and mass 50kg.
RetroTech: While computers may be built at, and rated
as, any TL above the optimum TL, a higher TL society
may produce a lower rated TL system for reduced cost
and mass. Any system may be built at any TL below
the society’s current level but not below the optimum TL
for the model. Each reduced level halves the cost and
mass of the basic model.
EXPERT SKILLS
Having a tool or weapon with the appropriate Expert
program and an Intelligent Interface can grant a Traveller
DM+1 to relevant checks. However, the program can
only help if the difficulty of the task is less than a certain
value. In combat, add up any negative DMs to determine
the effective difficulty of the attack or action.

Psionicology Science Toolkit:
Since the
psionicology toolkit is focused on the understanding of
psionic talent using the Science (psionicology) skill, it is
generally considered contraband on worlds that prohibit
the use of psionics. On those worlds, toolkits might be
in the hands of government operatives but outside the
confines of law enforcement or government-sanctioned
research mere possession could be a crime. The
toolkit includes testing equipment to determine the
latent PSI potential of an individual, including tests for
PSI strength and understanding talents, which can be
trained. The toolkit provides feedback analytics for both
psionic training and diagnosis of psionic-related mental
conditions or psionic blocks and includes a dose of
inhibitor drug to temporarily limit psionic ability.
Robotics Science Toolkit:
For use with the Science
(robotics) skill, this toolkit includes the tools to
diagnose, repair and construct robotic components. It
is not intended to allow for the construction of a robot
but may aid in repair and enhancement. It includes
debugging software for robotic brains, electronics
tools to repair or create connections between robotic
components and delicate mechanical tools to repair
or assemble a robot. This toolkit also provides DM+1
to robotic related tasks performed using Electronics

conditions and locate planets around distant stars and
allows for modelling of the risks of stellar activities
such as flares and other magnetic disturbances,
plus it can help identify the source of faint emissions
across the electromagnetic spectrum. Within a solar
system, the toolkit is focused on the properties of
the system’s stellar objects and general organisation
and development of smaller system bodies. When
used in conjunction with tasks related to the study of
planetary and smaller system bodies using the Science
(planetology) skill this toolkit provides DM+1.
Physical Sciences Toolkit:
This toolkit provides
instruments and analytic tools for the performance of
the Science skill specialities of chemistry and physics.
These tools including sampling equipment, chemical
analysis tools, sensors to detect electromagnetic or
gravitic radiation and ultrasensitive measurement
equipment. The toolkit can help a specialist analyse
unknown minerals, physical phenomena and the basic
composition and properties of everything from atoms to
stars. The toolkit can also aid the Science specialities
of astronomy and planetology by providing DM+1
in tasks which directly involve the measurement of
physical and chemical properties.
Social Science Expert Packages:
Social
sciences do not generally require tools but access
to methodologies, data collection algorithms and
large libraries of information, both qualitative and
quantitative. Social science expert packages are
installed on specialised dedicated computer tablets
running Intellect and Expert software in the speciality.
These computers contain extensive databases and

provide DM+2 to checks in the speciality. Travellers
unskilled in the Science speciality of the Expert system
may interact with the computer to understand or

With the advent of powered armour and portable

available in the Imperium are staggeringly powerful.
Few private citizens can obtain such weapons legally
but small brush wars can turn into alarming plasma-

Melee weapons are a symbol of status among the
nobility of many worlds but they also serve a useful
purpose in boarding actions. When attempting to
capture an enemy vessel, a sword is much less likely
to cause significant damage to vulnerable systems or
cause a hull breach than a gun but is better at opening
a self-sealing vacc suit to the airless cold of space.

a particular location does not apply to this spacecraft,
roll again.
The Severity of the critical hit is equal to the Effect of
the attack roll minus 5. Consult the Critical Hit Effects
table to determine the nature of the critical hit and how it
affects the spacecraft. Any extra damage caused by the
effects of critical hits ignores the spacecraft’s Armour.
If a spacecraft has already sustained a critical hit to a
location that receives another, use the Severity of the new
critical hit or the original plus one, whichever is higher
and immediately apply any new effects. Once a location
has reached Severity 6, it cannot suffer any more critical
hits. Instead, the spacecraft will receive 6D extra damage
every time the location suffers another critical hit.

BOARDING ACTIONS
There is little in space combat more exciting and
terrifying than a boarding action. Marines launch
themselves from a closely manoeuvring ship or
dedicated small craft and hurl themselves at an enemy
vessel in an attempt to gain entry and pacify the crew.
These actions lead to vicious firefights with high-
powered weaponry being used in the tight confines of a
ship’s corridors.
Once two ships are within less than one kilometre of
each other (Adjacent range), any marines on board
can launch a boarding action during the Actions Step.
A boarding action takes 2D rounds to complete, after
which its results are decided.
RESOLVING A BOARDING ACTION
To resolve a boarding action, both sides roll 2D, apply
the following modifiers and then the defender deducts
their total from that of the attacker. The final score is
then compared on the Boarding Actions table.
Boarding Actions
Superior Armour +1
Superior Weaponry +1
Superior Skills and Tactics +2
Superior Numbers +1
Vastly Superior Numbers +3
Defender has no Marines on duty -2
At their option, the referee may like to continue playing
out the boarding action at the Ground scale on any
‘fighting continues’ result. The attackers will have
successfully gained entry to the enemy ship and will
now be desperately trying to expand their way out of the
beachhead. This will be an opportunity for the Travellers
to make their own decisions when fighting the crew of
the enemy ship and of what targets they will try to reach.
Boarding Actions
Total Result
-7 or less The attackers are soundly defeated. If the attacker’s ship is docked with the defender’s, the
defenders may mount a new boarding action of their own and gain DM+4 on the roll to resolve it.
-4 to -6 The attackers are defeated. The attackers must retreat back to their own ship or space – if they are
unable to do so, they are killed or captured.
-1 to -3 Fighting continues. Resolve the boarding again in another 1D rounds but the defender gains DM+2 to
their roll. The ship being boarded loses 2D Hull.
0 Fighting continues. Resolve the boarding again in another 1D rounds.
1 to 3 Fighting continues. Resolve the boarding again in another 1D rounds but the attacker gains DM+2 to
their roll. The ship being boarded loses 2D Hull.
4 to 6 The boarding action is successful and the ship being boarded suffers 1D damage, ignoring any
armour. The attackers may take control of the ship after another 2D rounds of pacification.
7 or more The attackers storm the enemy ship and take control of it immediately.

POPULATION
The Population code measures the planet’s intelligent
population. The Population code can be generalised as
the number of zeroes following a one, so Population 6
indicates a population in the millions (1,000,000).
Population is generated with 2D–2. However, the
referee may like to introduce extremely high population
worlds (Population B or C) at their discretion.
LOW-POPULATION WORLDS
Planets with Population 3 or less are very small colonies
and may differ considerably from the descriptions in
the rest of this chapter. A world with Population 1 can
change its Government code with an argument over
dinner and is unlikely to bother with a worldwide network
of communications satellites even at TL15.
If a world has Population 0, it is uninhabited and so has
a Government, Law Level and Technology Level of 0.
GOVERNMENT
The Government code indicates a range of possible
ruling systems, determined by rolling 2D–7 and adding
the planet’s Population code.
The Common Contraband column on the Government
table determines goods such a government is likely to
restrict but should not be taken as a universal rule.

worlds are often undergoing upheaval or revolution, or
else are naturally hazardous environments.

Red worlds are interdicted and travel to them is
forbidden. A world might be Red because the Imperium
wishes to preserve it or because the world is too
dangerous to allow visitors. Interdictions are enforced
by the Imperial Navy.
