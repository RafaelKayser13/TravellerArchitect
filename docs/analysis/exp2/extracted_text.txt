Technology
Humans realise that Pentapods view themselves
as machines, each individual filling its niche in
the overall Pentapod society. To humans then,
Pentapods seem to be members of a species that, in
the pursuit of biotechnology, sadly lost its identity as
a collection of individuals.

THE SUNG
The Sung were the first sapient alien species to be
discovered by humans and in many ways bear the most
similarities to humans in culture and thought processes.
First Encounter
The Sung were first encountered in 2247 in their
home system by a Manchurian exploration team. First
contact occurred when the Manchurian expedition,
investigating mysterious signals from the system’s
third planet, detected a Sung interplanetary craft.
Assuming the source of the signals, as well as the
ship, was some unexpected human expedition, the
Manchurians attempted communication. The signals
that returned were obviously non-human and the
Manchurians panicked and fled from the system. They
returned directly to Earth, with the news that there were
technologically advanced aliens at the fringes of the
Manchurian Arm.
Another expedition was quickly sent back out. This joint
Manchurian-Canadian expedition consisted of a pair
of warships in case the aliens proved hostile, along
with a sophisticated survey vessel. These ships also
carried teams of exobiological, linguistic and diplomatic
experts. Remaining in the outer regions of the system
to avoid being seen as a threat, the expedition was
successful in initiating peaceful communications with
the Sung.

station orbiting the star attempted to make contact,
broadcasting greetings in several languages. The
alien vessels did attempt to respond but the language
gap was too wide. After a couple of days near the
only discharge point in the system, the alien vessels
withdrew back into unknown space.
Three years later, the aliens returned. This time, they
attacked without warning and captured the station,
then swept on to attack the nearby colony world of
Aurore. Human forces eventually drove the aliens off
but not before they landed several thousand troops
on the beleaguered colony world. The past two years
have been spent in vicious ground actions to eliminate
the invaders, who committed atrocities on the human
populations after the initial ladings, resulting in near
50% casualties in all three colonies.
From all accounts, the Kaefers live to fight. Even in
their camps, there appears to be little discipline, with
fights breaking out constantly.
Technology
Kaefer technology is almost uniformly sturdier and
bulkier than human equivalents. It is nonetheless
effective. On the average, the level of technology is very
similar to humans, with a couple of exceptions. First,
computers and electronics are notably heavier, slower
and less efficient than human designs, with follow-on

First Contact
In late 2299, a Trilon ISV-21 class exploratory vessel,
the LaFarge, was damaged by a Kaefer intruder, forcing
the remains of the crew to abandon the ship in orbit over
the second planet of the distant star DM+17 2611, which

The cave dragon is the largest of the so-called ‘draco-

and ‘evening’ phases of Beowulf’s very long day and
takes to caves and underground burrows for the hot
‘mid-day’ and the long, cold night, where it enters a sort
of hibernation for the coldest period.
The typical cave dragon is roughly the size of a terrestrial
heavy horse, fast and well-protected around its face and
mouth. Like many draco-forms, it can spit stomach acid
to blind and incapacitate prey. Between its armour and
over-all toughness, most smaller-calibre hunting weapons

SECTION 4: NEOS
Neos are genetically-altered animals, created to serve as companions to humans on hazardous colony worlds.
There is considerable controversy surrounding neos, as they all have near-human range intelligence, yet are
effectively enslaved through bio-chemical imprinting. The North American Research League (NARL) has long
campaigned for their production to be stopped. Oddly enough, the Life Foundation, usually an ardent supporter of
the rights of living things, does not support banning the production of neos, just of tighter controls over who can get

SECTION 5: PROTO-INTELLIGENCES
Under the terms of the Kigali Accords on Non-Human Intelligence, a proto-intelligence meets the criteria for
intelligence, including possessing reflective self-awareness, but not to the same degree as humans. Proto-
intelligences are therefore granted a certain set of rights, including the right to freedom of person, the right to life
and several other ‘human’ rights. However, under the terms of the Kigali Accords, proto-intelligences are legally
incompetent and thus wards of the state. Their rights can be infringed to a degree to protect them and others but not
without tribunal. Crimes committed against proto-intelligences carry the same weight as crimes committed against
humans and incur the same penalties. However, as wards of the state, proto-intelligences cannot be prosecuted for
their actions against humans, except in very special circumstances.
Birds Cetaceans
The corvids, which include crows and ravens, are Most cetacean species are recognised as proto-
