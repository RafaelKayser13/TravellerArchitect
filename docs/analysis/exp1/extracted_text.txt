2300AD is a science fiction roleplaying game built
on the gold-standard for science fiction games:
Traveller. Using the latest edition from Mongoose
Publishing, 2300AD is a universe designed with a
‘harder’ approach to science and science fiction. This
book requires the Traveller Core Book, which contains
the base rules and guidelines. This book provides
a new universe for Traveller, with new worlds, new
technologies and a new approach.
In the year 2300, humanity is reaching for the stars,
exploring and settling distant worlds. Despite nearly
destroying themselves during the decades of Twilight,
despite all the wars since, humanity has survived and
prospered. 2300AD is the story of humanity reaching
for the stars.
In 2300AD, humanity has colonies on 32 Earth-like
worlds, with outposts on many more. Space is divided
into three Arms: French, American and Manchurian,
each named for the dominant nation exploring it. The
shape of these Arms is dictated by the limitations
inherent in the stutterwarp effect, the engine that drives
faster-than-light travel. The stutterwarp has a maximum
range of 7.7 light years; beyond this range, drives can
undergo a relaxation event, releasing a burst of heat
and radiation that usually destroys the ship and kills
the crew. At best, the drive is destroyed in interstellar
space, far from rescue or hope.
Journeys from worlds at the centre of human space and
worlds of the edge can take weeks, or even months,
of travel. Situations on the Frontier must be solved by
local authorities, using equipment and expertise at hand.
Waiting for far-off colonial masters to decide and act has
doomed more than one colony, so self-reliance and skill
are premium survival tools for life on distant worlds.
At the centre of human space is the Core, which
contains the worlds of the Sol and the Alpha/Beta
Centauri systems. Tirane is a near-twin to Earth in
climate, gravity and atmosphere. These two worlds
together have nearly 90% of the human population,
with 75% of the total residing on Earth itself. For most
people living out on the Frontier, the worlds of the Core
are as distant and strange as any alien homeworld.

Across the Frontier, the safety and survival of human settlements depends to a
large degree on high technology. Medical equipment, filter masks, sensors, armour
and weapons, all are necessary to allow colonies to thrive. Even Soft Path colonies

The Frontier is a big place and there are many approaches to the design of tools

The French Empire is the most powerful economy in human space. This economic

Shock gloves have much the same effect as the shock

and the military. To the casual observer, they look like a
