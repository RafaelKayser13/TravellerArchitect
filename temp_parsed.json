    "desc": "Travellers from the Frontier can hail from any world with practically any gravity type, from Light gravity worlds to the Extreme gravity of King. Zero-gravity environments are the domain of Spacers who are covered on page 9. Information on world gravity type is available in each world description and the table in The Worlds of 2300AD page 23. Gravity type is used when travelling to different worlds, to find the effect of the differences between homeworld gravity and local gravity on each Traveller. In general, Travellers from low-gravity worlds will be taller and more slender than average, while those from high-gravity worlds will tend to be shorter and stockier."

Check the Survival DM on the Colonies table in Book 2 page 23, and use it for all Survival rolls until the Traveller leaves their homeworld. This roll may also be modified by DNA Modifications and Symbionts. As well as having a Survival DM for the world, some colonies are particularly primitive or advanced and have further modifiers noted in their description. For example, the Incan colony on Heidelsheimat inflicts DM-1 to Survival rolls due to its primitive nature and lack of support, while the Texan and Bavarian colonies do not have any such modifier. All tailored DNAMs provide DM+1 to Survival rolls."

The round will have hit its target well before the shockwave of its passage will have reached any observers. The FTE-10 can also penetrate light vehicle armour and hardsuits at reasonable ranges. Due to its great physical length, the FTE-10 has been nicknamed the 'Kentucky long rifle' among American soldiers. Although long and bulky, the accurate, long-range firepower makes it a useful weapon for any infantry unit. The FTE-10 comes equipped with a 1,000 metre electronic sight with red-dot, imaging, telescopic, low-light and thermal imaging capabilities."

In service, however, the weapon proved disappointing.
